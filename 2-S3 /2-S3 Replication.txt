2-S3 Replication
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 replication automatically copies objects from a source bucket to a destination bucket.
- **Types**:
  - **Cross Region Replication (CRR)**: Replicates objects to buckets in different AWS regions.
  - **Same Region Replication (SRR)**: Replicates objects within the same AWS region.
- **Key Benefit**: Enhances data resilience, reduces latency, aids in compliance (e.g., data sovereignty), and supports backup and disaster recovery.

2. Replication Architecture & Configuration
---------------------------------------------
- **Replication Configuration**:
  - Set up on the **source bucket**.
  - Specifies the destination bucket and an IAM role for replication.
  - **IAM Role**: Must have a trust policy that allows S3 to assume the role; the roleâ€™s permissions grant read access to the source and write access to the destination.
- **Same Account vs. Different Account**:
  - *Same Account*: Both buckets are owned by the same AWS account, so the IAM role automatically has required trust.
  - *Different Accounts*: The destination bucket (in a separate account) must have a bucket policy that explicitly grants the source account's IAM role permission to write objects.

3. Replication Options and Features
-------------------------------------
- **Object Filtering**:
  - You can replicate all objects by default or filter by prefixes and tags.
- **Destination Storage Class Override**:
  - Default: The destination retains the same storage class as the source.
  - Option: Override to a different (often lower-cost) storage class for secondary copies.
- **Object Ownership**:
  - Default: Objects in the destination bucket are owned by the source account.
  - Option: Override so that objects are owned by the destination account (important for cross-account replication).
- **Replication Time Control (RTC)**:
  - Provides a guaranteed 15-minute replication SLA along with additional monitoring.
  - Use RTC when strict synchronization between source and destination is required.

4. Key Considerations & Limitations
-------------------------------------
- **Non-Retroactivity**: Replication only applies to objects created after replication is enabled (unless specifically configured for existing objects).
- **Versioning Requirement**: Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
- **One-Way Process**: Replication is unidirectional by default (from source to destination). (Bidirectional replication is available but requires additional configuration.)
- **Encryption Support**:
  - Supports unencrypted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS.
  - Special configuration is needed for replicating objects encrypted with customer-managed keys.
- **Ownership & Permissions**:
  - Only objects owned by the source account are replicated.
  - If cross-account, ensure the destination bucket policy permits access to the replication IAM role.
- **System Events & Lifecycle Actions**:
  - Replication does not copy system events or lifecycle management actions (such as transitions and expirations).
- **Glacier Limitations**: Objects stored using Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive classes are not replicated.

5. Use Cases
------------
- **Cross Region Replication (CRR)**:
  - Global resilience and disaster recovery.
  - Reducing latency by replicating data closer to end users.
- **Same Region Replication (SRR)**:
  - Log aggregation from multiple buckets.
  - Synchronization between production and test or departmental accounts.
  - Data isolation for compliance or audit purposes.

6. Comparison Table: Replication in Same vs. Different AWS Accounts

| Replication Type          | Bucket Ownership                 | Required Bucket Policy on Destination                  | Typical Use Case                                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Same Account Replication  | Both buckets owned by same account | Not required; role automatically trusted within account | Internal backup, data sync within a single organization |
| Cross Account Replication | Buckets owned by different accounts | Required; destination bucket must grant write access to source account's IAM role | Data isolation, compliance, and sharing between departments or external partners |
