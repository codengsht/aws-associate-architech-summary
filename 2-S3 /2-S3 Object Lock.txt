2-S3 Object Lock
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 Object Lock is used to prevent objects from being overwritten or deleted for a specified retention period.
- **Use Cases**: Critical for compliance (e.g., legal, financial, or medical records) and for preventing accidental deletions.
- **Prerequisite**: Requires versioning to be enabled on the S3 bucket. Object lock settings apply to individual object versions.

2. Key Components of Object Lock
----------------------------------
- **Object Retention**: Locks an object version for a specified period.
  - **Retention Modes**:
    - **Compliance Mode**:
      - Once set, the retention period cannot be shortened or modified by anyone—not even the root user.
      - Intended for strict regulatory requirements.
    - **Governance Mode**:
      - Retention settings can be overridden if the requester has the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission and provides the proper header.
      - Useful for preventing accidental deletions while allowing flexibility when needed.
- **Legal Hold**:
  - A binary (on/off) state applied to an object version.
  - When enabled, the object version cannot be deleted or overwritten regardless of retention settings.
  - Can be removed (turned off) to allow normal operations.

3. How Object Lock Works
-------------------------
- **Retention Period**:
  - Defined either on individual object versions or set as a bucket default.
  - The object remains immutable for the duration of the retention period.
  - In **Compliance Mode**, the period is strictly enforced and cannot be reduced.
  - In **Governance Mode**, authorized users can override the lock using special permissions.
- **Legal Hold**:
  - Independently locks the object version.
  - Does not have a duration—it remains in effect until manually removed.
  - Can be used in combination with retention settings.

4. Interaction of Features
---------------------------
- **Combination Usage**:
  - An object version may have a retention period (in either compliance or governance mode) and/or a legal hold.
  - Legal hold and retention can overlap, making the object even more secure against deletion or modification.
- **Permissions and Overrides**:
  - In governance mode, users with the appropriate permission (`s3:BypassGovernanceRetention`) can modify or delete the object before the retention period expires.
  - In compliance mode, no user (even with override permissions) can shorten or cancel the retention period.

5. Exam Key Points
------------------
- **Retention vs. Legal Hold**:
  - **Retention**: Sets a period during which an object version is locked.
  - **Legal Hold**: A binary on/off setting that prevents deletion irrespective of time.
- **Mode Differences**:
  - **Compliance Mode**: Immutable for the retention period.
  - **Governance Mode**: Can be overridden with proper permissions.
- **Combined Effects**:
  - Both features can be used together for layered protection.
  - Understand the implications of each mode for meeting compliance and operational requirements.
