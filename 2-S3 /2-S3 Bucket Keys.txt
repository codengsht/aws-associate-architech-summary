2-S3 Bucket Keys
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Topic**: Discussion of S3 Bucket Keys—a feature designed to reduce costs and improve scalability when using KMS encryption.
- **Context**: Focused on the architecture and operational impact when encrypting objects in S3 with SSE-KMS.

2. Default SSE-KMS Encryption Flow
-----------------------------------
- **Standard Process**:
  - Every object uploaded to an S3 bucket with SSE-KMS requires a call to KMS.
  - KMS generates a unique Data Encryption Key (DEK) per object.
  - The object is encrypted with this DEK, and both the encrypted object and its corresponding DEK are stored in S3.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Cost**: Each KMS API call incurs a cost.
  - **Throttling**: KMS limits the number of DEK generation calls (e.g., 50,000–100,000 calls per second per region), which can restrict scalability when dealing with high volumes (e.g., thousands of objects per second).

3. S3 Bucket Keys Architecture
-------------------------------
- **Mechanism**:
  - Instead of making a KMS call for each object, S3 uses a time-limited "bucket key."
  - The KMS key generates a bucket key that is then used by S3 to encrypt DEKs for individual objects.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Reduced KMS Calls**: Offloads most encryption operations from KMS to S3.
  - **Lower Costs**: Fewer KMS API calls reduce the overall cost.
  - **Improved Scalability**: Limits on KMS calls are mitigated, allowing higher ingestion rates.

4. Key Considerations and Nuances
-----------------------------------
- **Logging**:
  - CloudTrail logs will show the bucket ARN instead of individual object ARNs.
  - Fewer KMS-related CloudTrail events will be recorded.
- **Replication**:
  - S3 bucket keys work with both same-region and cross-region replication.
  - For replicated objects, encryption settings are typically preserved.
  - Note: If a plaintext object is replicated to a bucket with default encryption, S3 encrypts it at the destination, which may result in different ETags between source and destination.

*Comparison Table: SSE-KMS with vs. without Bucket Keys*

| Aspect                   | Standard SSE-KMS                        | SSE-KMS with Bucket Keys                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| DEK Generation           | One KMS call per object                 | One KMS call per bucket key (used for multiple objects) |
| Cost                     | Higher due to frequent KMS API calls    | Lower, due to reduced number of KMS calls         |
| Scalability              | Limited by KMS throttling limits        | Improved; offloads work to S3                     |
| CloudTrail Logging       | Logs show individual object ARNs        | Logs show bucket ARN; fewer KMS events            |
| Replication Behavior     | Preserves individual object encryption settings | Works with same and cross-region replication; may affect ETags |

5. Conclusion
-------------
- **Summary**: S3 bucket keys provide an effective solution for reducing costs and increasing scalability when using SSE-KMS by minimizing the number of direct calls to KMS.
- **Impact**: This feature is especially beneficial in high-throughput scenarios, ensuring that KMS limits and costs do not impede performance.
- **Next Steps**: Familiarize yourself with the detailed nuances (e.g., replication behaviors and logging changes) as these may be critical for AWS exams and practical deployments.
