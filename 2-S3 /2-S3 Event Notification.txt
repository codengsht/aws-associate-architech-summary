2-S3 Event Notification
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 Event Notifications enable you to trigger actions automatically when certain events occur in an S3 bucket.
- **Use Cases**: Automate workflows, process images, handle deletions, monitor object restores, and track replication events.

2. How S3 Event Notifications Work
-----------------------------------
- **Configuration**: 
  - Set up event notification rules on an S3 bucket.
  - Rules specify which events (e.g., object creation, deletion, restore, or replication) trigger notifications.
  - Rules can be scoped by object prefixes or tags.
- **Event Flow**:
  - When an event occurs in the bucket, S3 generates an event notification.
  - The event is delivered to configured destinations such as SNS topics, SQS queues, or Lambda functions.
  - S3 uses its own internal "S3 principal" to send the event, so destination services must allow S3 (via resource policies).

3. Supported Event Types
------------------------
- **Object Creation Events**:
  - Triggered when objects are added (e.g., via PUT, POST, COPY, or completion of multipart uploads).
  - *Use Case*: Process or transform new images.
- **Object Deletion Events**:
  - Triggered when objects or delete markers are removed.
  - *Use Case*: Monitor unauthorized deletions or maintain audit logs.
- **Object Restore Events**:
  - Triggered when restore operations from Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive begin or complete.
  - *Use Case*: Notify users or systems about data availability.
- **Replication Events**:
  - Triggered for events related to replication status (e.g., when replication exceeds a 15-minute threshold or fails).
  - *Use Case*: Monitor and troubleshoot replication processes.

*Comparison Table: Key S3 Event Types*

| Event Type           | Description                                              | Typical Use Case                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Object Creation      | Triggered on object uploads (PUT, POST, COPY, multipart completion) | Process new files (e.g., image transformation)   |
| Object Deletion      | Triggered on deletions or delete marker creation         | Audit and security monitoring                     |
| Object Restore       | Triggered when objects in Glacier are restored            | Notify users or systems when archived data becomes available |
| Replication          | Triggered on replication events (e.g., delays, failures)  | Monitor replication status and handle errors       |

4. Architecture & Configuration
---------------------------------
- **Event Notification Setup**:
  - Defined on the source S3 bucket.
  - Specifies event filters, destinations, and (if needed) additional actions.
- **Destinations**:
  - **SNS Topics**: Publish messages for fan-out to multiple subscribers.
  - **SQS Queues**: Queue events for processing by consumers.
  - **Lambda Functions**: Trigger serverless processing workflows.
- **Resource Policies**:
  - Necessary on destination services (e.g., Lambda, SQS) to allow S3 to send notifications.
  - Policies must grant the S3 service principal permission to invoke actions on these resources.
- **EventBridge Alternative**:
  - AWS EventBridge offers broader event handling and integration.
  - EventBridge may be preferred for more complex, scalable, or cross-service event management.
