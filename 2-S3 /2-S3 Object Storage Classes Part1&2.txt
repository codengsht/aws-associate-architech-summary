2-S3 Object Storage Classes Part1&2
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: Understand the different S3 storage classes, their costs, technical features, and trade-offs.
- **Exam Relevance**: Important for both associate and professional levels to select the correct storage class based on usage, durability, latency, and cost considerations.

2. S3 Standard
--------------
- **Replication**: Data is stored across at least three Availability Zones.
- **Durability**: 11 nines; extremely durable (e.g., losing 1 object in 10 million takes thousands of years).
- **Access**: Millisecond latency with immediate availability; supports public access via S3 permissions or static website hosting.
- **Cost Model**: Charged per GB-month for storage, per request, and per GB of data transferred out. No minimum duration or size restrictions.
- **Use Case**: Default for critical, frequently accessed, and irreplaceable data.

3. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)
------------------------------------------------
- **Replication & Durability**: Similar to S3 Standard (data in at least three AZs; 11 nines durability).
- **Cost Benefits**: Lower storage cost (about half the price) compared to S3 Standard.
- **Additional Charges**: Retrieval fees per GB retrieved.
- **Minimums**: Minimum storage duration of 30 days and a minimum charge for objects of 128 KB.
- **Use Case**: Best for long-lived but infrequently accessed data (avoid using for small, frequently updated, or temporary files).

4. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)
------------------------------------------------
- **Replication**: Data is stored in a single Availability Zone.
- **Cost**: Lower cost than Standard-IA due to reduced redundancy.
- **Risk**: Increased risk of data loss if the single Availability Zone fails, though data remains durable within that zone.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for non-critical, reproducible data, or secondary backup copies.

5. Glacier Storage Classes
---------------------------
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval**:
  - **Performance**: Provides instant access like Standard-IA but with lower storage costs.
  - **Minimum Duration**: 90-day minimum.
  - **Retrieval Cost**: Higher retrieval fees.
  - **Use Case**: For data that must be accessed instantly but very infrequently (e.g., quarterly).

- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier)**:
  - **Performance**: Data is not immediately available; requires a retrieval job.
  - **Retrieval Options**: 
    - Expedited: Data available within ~5 minutes.
    - Standard: Data available in 3-5 hours.
    - Bulk: Data available in 5-12 hours.
  - **Minimum Duration & Size**: 90-day minimum; objects have a 40 KB minimum billable size.
  - **Use Case**: For archival data where occasional access is acceptable within minutes to hours.

- **Glacier Deep Archive**:
  - **Performance**: Data is in a “frozen” state.
  - **Retrieval Times**: Standard retrieval takes 12 hours; bulk can take up to 48 hours.
  - **Cost**: Lowest storage cost.
  - **Minimums**: Same as Glacier Flexible Retrieval (40 KB, 90-day minimum).
  - **Use Case**: For long-term archival data with very infrequent access where retrieval latency is acceptable (e.g., legal records, long-term backups).

6. Intelligent-Tiering
------------------------
- **Mechanism**: Automatically moves objects between tiers based on changing access patterns.
- **Tiers**: Includes frequent access, infrequent access, archive instant access, archive access, and deep archive tiers.
- **Operation**: 
  - Objects start in the frequent access tier and are automatically transitioned based on access history.
  - When objects are frequently accessed again, they are moved back without incurring retrieval charges.
- **Cost Consideration**: Incurs a small monitoring/automation fee per 1,000 objects, in addition to standard storage and retrieval fees.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for long-lived data with unpredictable access patterns.
