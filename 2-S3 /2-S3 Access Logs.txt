2-S3 Access Logs
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 Access Logs capture detailed information about requests made to a source bucket.
- **Usage**: Useful for security audits, monitoring access patterns, and understanding S3 billing details.

2. How It Works
---------------
- **Source Bucket**: The bucket for which you want to record access activity.
- **Target Bucket**: The destination bucket where log files are stored.
- **Configuration**:
  - Enable logging on the source bucket via the AWS console, API, or CLI.
  - Specify the target bucket (and an optional prefix) for log delivery.
  - Logging is managed by the S3 Log Delivery group, which must be granted appropriate permissions (using ACLs) on the target bucket.
- **Delay**: Changes to logging configuration may take several hours to propagate.

3. Log File Details
-------------------
- **Format**:
  - Log files are delivered as newline-delimited text files.
  - Each log record contains space-delimited attributes (e.g., date, time, requester, operation, status code, error code, etc.), similar to Apache logs.
- **Content**: Provides detailed data for each request made to the source bucket.

4. Management Considerations
----------------------------
- **Multi-Bucket Logging**: A single target bucket can collect logs from multiple source buckets by using unique prefixes.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Log files are not automatically deleted or transitioned. You must manage log retention and deletion (e.g., via lifecycle policies).

5. Use Cases
------------
- **Security**: Monitor and audit access for compliance.
- **Performance and Cost Analysis**: Understand usage patterns and S3 billing impacts.
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify and diagnose issues by reviewing detailed access logs.
