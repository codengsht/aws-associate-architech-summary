2-S3 Requester Pays
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 Requester Pays shifts the data transfer cost responsibility from the bucket owner to the requester.
- **Scenario**: Two buckets—one normal (owned by Julie) and one with Requester Pays enabled (owned by Mike)—illustrate the cost difference when serving popular datasets.

2. How It Works
---------------
- **Standard Bucket (Julie’s)**:
  - Data uploads are free.
  - Data retrieval costs (data transfer charges) are borne by the bucket owner.
  - Can be used with unauthenticated access methods like static website hosting and BitTorrent.
- **Requester Pays Bucket (Mike’s)**:
  - Bucket setting is configured to shift download costs to the requester.
  - Only authenticated requests are allowed; unauthenticated access (e.g., via static website hosting or BitTorrent) is not supported.
  - Requesters must include the header `x-amz-request-payer` to confirm they agree to pay for data transfer charges.
  - This approach can greatly reduce costs for the bucket owner when data is accessed by many users.

3. Key Considerations
---------------------
- **Authentication Requirement**: 
  - Requesters must be authenticated users.
  - The `x-amz-request-payer` header must be included in requests.
- **Cost Allocation**:
  - In Requester Pays buckets, each download incurs a cost charged to the requester’s account.
  - This is particularly beneficial for buckets hosting popular datasets, especially for smaller businesses.
- **Limitations**:
  - Requester Pays cannot be used with features that require unauthenticated access (e.g., static website hosting, BitTorrent).

4. Comparison Table: Normal vs. Requester Pays Buckets

| Aspect                    | Normal Bucket (Owner Pays)         | Requester Pays Bucket                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data Upload Cost          | Free                               | Free                                              |
| Data Download Cost        | Billed to bucket owner             | Billed to requester (must include header)         |
| Authentication Requirement| Not mandatory for access methods   | Mandatory; only authenticated requests allowed    |
| Supported Access Methods  | Supports unauthenticated methods   | Does not support static website hosting or BitTorrent |
| Ideal Use Case            | Low-traffic or internal datasets   | Popular datasets with high download volumes       |
