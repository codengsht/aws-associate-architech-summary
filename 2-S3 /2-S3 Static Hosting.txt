2-S3 Static Hosting
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 Static Website Hosting allows S3 buckets to serve content directly via HTTP, making them accessible to web browsers without using AWS APIs.
- **Default Behavior**: By default, S3 is accessed via APIs; static website hosting enables standard web access using HTML pages.

2. How It Works
---------------
- **Configuration**:
  - Enable static website hosting on an S3 bucket.
  - Specify an **index document** (e.g., index.html) and an **error document** (e.g., error.html).
  - AWS automatically generates a static website endpoint based on the bucket name and region.
- **Custom Domains**:
  - To use a custom domain, the bucket name must exactly match the domain name.
- **Content Requirements**:
  - All served files should be HTML (or other web content) as static website hosting delivers HTML content.
  
3. Common Use Cases
--------------------
- **Simple Websites/Blogs**:
  - Host static sites like personal blogs, documentation sites, or portfolios.
- **Offloading Media**:
  - Use static hosting to serve large media files (images, videos) separately, reducing load on primary compute services.
- **Out-of-Band Pages**:
  - Serve maintenance or status pages during downtime, ensuring availability even when the main server is offline.

4. Pricing Model
----------------
- **Storage**: Billed per GB-month of storage.
- **Data Transfer**: Free inbound data; outbound transfers incur charges per GB.
- **Request Costs**: Each API operation (GET, PUT, LIST, etc.) is charged per 1,000 requests.
- **Free Tier**: Includes 5 GB of storage, 20,000 GET requests, and 2,000 PUT requests monthly.

5. Benefits and Considerations
-------------------------------
- **Cost Efficiency**: S3 offers very low storage and transfer costs, even for heavy usage.
- **Scalability**: S3 can handle vast amounts of data and high traffic volumes with minimal charges.
- **Use Case Suitability**:
  - Ideal for serving static content that does not require server-side processing.
  - Consider offloading static media and out-of-band pages to reduce the load (and cost) on your primary compute services.
