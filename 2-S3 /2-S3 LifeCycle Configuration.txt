2-S3 LifeCycle Configuration
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: S3 lifecycle configuration allows you to automatically transition or expire objects in an S3 bucket.
- **Benefits**: Optimizes cost and management for large buckets by automating storage class changes and object deletions.

2. Lifecycle Configuration Basics
-----------------------------------
- **Rules**: A lifecycle configuration consists of rules that apply actions to objects based on specified criteria.
  - **Scope**: Rules can target all objects in a bucket or a subset defined by prefixes or tags.
- **Actions**: Two main types of actions can be applied:
  - **Transition Actions**: Change the storage class of objects (e.g., moving from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days).
  - **Expiration Actions**: Permanently delete objects or object versions after a defined period.

3. Transition Flow and Rules
-----------------------------
- **Conceptual Flow ("Waterfall" Model)**:
  - Objects typically transition downward from higher-cost, high-performance classes to lower-cost archival classes as they age.
  - **Allowed Transitions**:
    - **S3 Standard** can transition to:
      - Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering, and Glacier classes.
    - **Standard-IA / One Zone-IA / Intelligent-Tiering** can transition to:
      - Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or Glacier Deep Archive.
  - **Direction**: Transitions can only move downward (e.g., from Standard to IA or Glacier) and cannot be reversed within a single rule.

4. Restrictions & Considerations
----------------------------------
- **Time-Based Minimums**:
  - **30-Day Rule**: An object must reside in S3 Standard for at least 30 days before transitioning to Standard-IA or One Zone-IA.
  - **Glacier Transition**: When using a single rule to move objects from S3 Standard through IA to Glacier classes, there is an additional 30-day requirement in the IA tier before transitioning to any Glacier tier.
- **Object Size Considerations**:
  - Small objects may incur equal or higher costs when transitioned due to minimum storage charge requirements (e.g., minimum 128 KB for IA classes).
- **Non-Access Based**:
  - Lifecycle rules operate solely on time criteria (not on access frequency). (Automatic transitions based on access are handled by Intelligent-Tiering.)

5. Example Use Case
-------------------
- **Scenario**: An object (e.g., a photo) is initially stored in S3 Standard.
  - **After 30 days**: Transition to Standard-IA or One Zone-IA.
  - **After 90 days**: Transition to a Glacier storage class (following the required additional wait in IA if using a single rule).
  - **Final Stage**: Optionally, expire (delete) the object if it is no longer needed.

6. Lifecycle Transition Requirements Table

| Transition Scenario                           | Minimum Duration Requirement | Comments                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| S3 Standard → Standard-IA / One Zone-IA       | 30 days                      | Must remain in Standard for at least 30 days               |
| Standard-IA / One Zone-IA → Glacier Classes     | Additional 30 days           | If using a single rule, must be in IA for 30 days before Glacier |
| S3 Standard directly to other classes*       | Varies                       | Direct changes via CLI are allowed; lifecycle rules enforce timing constraints |

*Note: When using lifecycle rules, objects must adhere to the timing requirements outlined above.
