9-Aurora Global Database
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- **Purpose:** Enables global-level replication for Aurora clusters.
- **Replication:** Data is replicated from a primary region to up to 5 secondary AWS regions.
- **Exam Awareness:** Understand that Aurora Global Database provides cross-region disaster recovery and global read scaling, even if it isnâ€™t a major exam focus.

2. Architecture
---------------
- **Primary Region:**
  - Functions like a standard Aurora cluster.
  - Contains one read/write primary instance along with up to 15 read-only replicas.
- **Secondary Regions:**
  - Consist entirely of read-only replicas (up to 16 per region).
  - Data is replicated from the primary at the storage layer with a typical replication time of under one second.
  - Secondary clusters are read-only by default but can be promoted to read/write in disaster scenarios.
- **Data Flow & Performance:**
  - Writes occur in the primary region; replicas (in both primary and secondary regions) handle read operations.
  - Replication happens at the storage layer, incurring no extra ACU usage and not impacting performance.

3. Use Cases
------------
- **Cross-Region Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity:**
  - In the event of a regional failure, a secondary region can be promoted to become the new primary.
  - Provides very low Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
- **Global Scaling:**
  - Enhances performance for international users by offloading read traffic to geographically closer secondary regions.
  - Reduces latency and improves user experience across different regions.

4. Key Exam Points
------------------
- Aurora Global Database supports up to 5 secondary regions.
- The primary region operates as a standard Aurora cluster (1 primary, up to 15 replicas).
- Secondary regions are entirely read-only (up to 16 replicas each) and replicate data within ~1 second.
- Replication is one-way (from primary to secondary) and is handled at the storage layer.
- Use cases include disaster recovery, business continuity, and global read scaling.

5. Comparison Table: Primary vs. Secondary Regions
---------------------------------------------------

| Aspect                  | Primary Region                                  | Secondary Region                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Instance Role           | 1 read/write primary + up to 15 read replicas    | Read-only replicas (up to 16 per region)     |
| Data Replication        | Writes processed and replicated at storage layer | Receives replicated data from primary (<1 sec)|
| Write Capability        | Supports write operations                        | Read-only (until promoted in disaster)       |
| Use Cases               | Daily operations, handling read/write traffic    | Cross-region DR, global read scaling         |
| Promotion               | Default primary                                  | Can be promoted to primary during a disaster |

6. Conclusion
-------------
- Aurora Global Database extends standard Aurora functionality across multiple regions.
- It ensures high availability, low latency, and robust disaster recovery by replicating data quickly and efficiently.
- For exams, be aware of its architecture, replication mechanism, and use cases for global scalability and continuity.
