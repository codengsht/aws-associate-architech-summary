9-Database Migration Service (DMS)
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- DMS is a fully managed service designed to simplify database migrations.
- It is used to move data between different database engines or from on‐premises to AWS with minimal downtime.
- At least one of the endpoints (source or target) must reside within AWS.

2. Key Components of DMS
-------------------------
- **Replication Instance:**
  - Runs on an EC2 instance and hosts the migration software.
  - Executes one or more replication tasks.
- **Replication Tasks:**
  - Define source and destination endpoints with the necessary connection and migration details.
  - Facilitate data movement from the source to the target database.

3. Migration Task Types
-----------------------
- **Full Load Migration:**
  - Copies existing data from the source to the target.
  - Suitable if a scheduled downtime is acceptable.
- **Full Load + Change Data Capture (CDC):**
  - Performs a full initial data load and then captures ongoing changes.
  - Enables near zero-downtime migration by syncing changes until cutover.
- **CDC Only:**
  - Migrates only the incremental changes.
  - Often used when the bulk data is migrated by other means (e.g., native export/import).

   Comparison Table: Migration Task Types
   ----------------------------------------

   | Task Type            | Description                                                | Use Case                                         |
   |----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | Full Load            | Migrates all existing data in one go                       | When downtime is acceptable                      |
   | Full Load + CDC      | Migrates data and then continuously applies changes         | Near zero-downtime migrations                    |
   | CDC Only             | Migrates only ongoing changes after initial data load       | When initial bulk migration is done externally    |

4. Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
-------------------------------
- **Purpose:** Converts database schema and code when migrating between different database engines.
- **Usage:**
  - Used only when the source and target engines differ (e.g., from Oracle to AWS RDS MySQL).
  - Supports traditional RDBMS (MySQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle) and OLAP systems (Teradata, Vertica, Greenplum).
  - Converts schema into a generic file format to facilitate migration.
- **Key Rule:** SCT is *not* used if both source and target databases use the same engine.

5. Integration with Snowball for Large Migrations
--------------------------------------------------
- **Challenge:** Migrating multi-terabyte databases over the network can be inefficient.
- **Solution:**
  - DMS can work in conjunction with AWS Snowball for offline bulk data transfer.
  - **Process:**
    1. Use SCT to extract data into a generic file format.
    2. Transfer data to a Snowball device.
    3. Ship the device to AWS, where data is loaded into an S3 bucket.
    4. DMS then imports data from S3 to the target database.
  - This method minimizes network usage and accelerates migration for very large databases.

6. Exam Power-Up Points
-----------------------
- **DMS Use Cases:** Default to DMS for any database migration scenarios in AWS exams, especially for "no downtime" migrations.
- **Endpoint Requirement:** Remember that one endpoint must be within AWS.
- **Task Selection:** Understand the differences between full load, full load with CDC, and CDC-only tasks.
- **SCT Role:** Know that SCT is only used when converting schemas between different database engines.
- **Snowball Integration:** Be aware that DMS can integrate with Snowball for large data volumes when network transfer isn’t practical.

7. Conclusion
-------------
- DMS simplifies complex, manual migration processes by automating data replication tasks.
- It supports various migration strategies tailored to downtime tolerance and data volume.
- Combined with SCT and Snowball, DMS provides a comprehensive solution for heterogeneous and large-scale migrations, making it a critical tool for AWS solutions architects.
