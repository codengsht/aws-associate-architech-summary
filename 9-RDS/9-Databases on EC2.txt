9-Databases on EC2
==============================================

1. Overview
-----------
- This lecture discusses the pros and cons of running databases directly on AWS EC2.
- While AWS offers many managed database services, deploying a database on EC2 can sometimes be justified but generally comes with significant drawbacks.
- The discussion is framed around architectural choices, administrative overhead, and exam-related scenarios.

2. Architectural Models for Running Databases on EC2
-----------------------------------------------------
- **Single Instance Architecture:**
  - Both the application (e.g., a WordPress stack) and the database run on a single EC2 instance.
  - Simpler setup but less scalable and resilient.
  
- **Split Architecture:**
  - The application and database are hosted on separate EC2 instances.
  - These instances can be located in the same Availability Zone (free internal communication) or across different zones (incurs inter-AZ data transfer costs).
  - Introduces a dependency on reliable communication between the instances.

3. Reasons to Run Databases on EC2 (Justifications)
----------------------------------------------------
- **OS-Level Access:**
  - Required when deep customization or tuning of the database is necessary.
  - Often driven by application vendor requirements rather than actual business needs.
  
- **Unsupported Database Versions:**
  - Needed when a specific database or version is not available via AWS managed services.
  
- **Specific Project Requirements:**
  - Detailed or niche requirements might necessitate a particular OS and database version combination.
  
- **Organizational Mandates:**
  - Sometimes decision makers demand databases on EC2, even if itâ€™s not best practice.

4. Reasons Against Running Databases on EC2 (Drawbacks)
---------------------------------------------------------
- **Administrative Overhead:**
  - Increased effort required for patching, upgrading, and general maintenance of both the EC2 instance and the database.
  
- **Backups and Disaster Recovery (DR):**
  - Greater complexity in setting up and managing backups and DR strategies compared to managed services.
  
- **Availability Zone Limitations:**
  - Typically, an EC2-based database runs in a single Availability Zone, increasing risk if that zone encounters issues.
  
- **Limited Advanced Features:**
  - Managed database products offer performance optimizations and advanced features that are not available when self-managing on EC2.
  
- **Scalability Challenges:**
  - EC2 instances do not scale as flexibly as managed services; they have fixed costs and can struggle with bursty demand.
  
- **Replication Complexity:**
  - Manual configuration and maintenance of replication increase the risk and management burden.

5. Exam Power-Up Points
------------------------
- **Justification Scenarios:** Be ready to identify scenarios where running a database on EC2 might be necessary (e.g., specific version requirements or OS-level access needs).
- **Trade-Off Analysis:** Understand that while self-managing on EC2 offers complete control, it also introduces significant administrative and scalability challenges.
- **AWS Managed Advantages:** Recognize that AWS managed database products generally provide better scalability, reduced management overhead, and advanced features.
- **Critical Evaluation:** When exam questions present scenarios involving databases on EC2, evaluate the need for OS-level access versus the benefits of managed services.

6. Final Conclusion
-------------------
- Running databases on EC2 can be done, but it is generally considered a bad practice due to the heavy administrative overhead, limited scalability, and potential for increased risk.
- The benefits of using AWS managed database products typically outweigh the flexibility offered by self-managed EC2 deployments.
- Future demos will illustrate transitioning from a monolithic deployment to a split architecture, paving the way for migration to managed database services.

| OS-Level Access                | Enables fine-tuning and custom configurations             | Often unnecessary; driven by vendor demands rather than business needs  |
| Database Version Support       | Allows use of niche or unsupported database versions      | Managed services cover most use cases; self-management is complex        |
| Administrative Overhead        | Complete control over the environment                     | High effort for patching, upgrades, backups, and DR                     |
| Scalability                    | Customizable to specific requirements                     | Fixed instance costs; limited auto-scaling; risk with single AZ usage     |
| Advanced Features              | Possibility for custom implementations                    | Miss out on AWS advanced features and performance optimizations         |
| Replication & Availability     | Flexible design choices                                   | Increased complexity; potential costs when spanning multiple AZs         |
