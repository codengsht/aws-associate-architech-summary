9-RDS Custom
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- RDS Custom is a niche feature that bridges the gap between standard RDS (fully managed, limited OS access) and self-managed databases on EC2.
- It is designed for scenarios where deeper customization and direct OS/engine access are needed.

2. Purpose of RDS Custom
------------------------
- Provides a middle ground:
  - **Standard RDS:** Offers a managed database server with limited access (no SSH/OS-level control).
  - **EC2-based Databases:** Offer complete control but require full management of OS, patches, backups, and high availability.
- RDS Custom allows some level of customization while still leveraging RDS automation and AWS management for many tasks.

3. Key Features
---------------
- **Direct Access:** 
  - Enables connections via SSH, RDP, or Session Manager, providing access to the operating system and database engine.
- **Supported Engines:** 
  - Currently available for Oracle and Microsoft SQL.
- **In-Account Deployment:** 
  - Unlike standard RDS, RDS Custom runs within your AWS account, so you can see EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and backups in your account.
- **Automation Control:** 
  - You can pause the automated management processes to perform customizations and then resume full automation.

4. Access and Management
-------------------------
- **Customization Flexibility:** 
  - Offers increased control over the database environment while still benefiting from AWS-managed infrastructure.
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** 
  - AWS manages the underlying hardware and basic infrastructure.
  - Customers retain responsibility for application optimization and any custom configurations.

5. Service Model Comparison
---------------------------
| Service Model         | AWS Responsibility                          | Customer Responsibility                     | Customization/Access             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| On-Premises           | None                                        | Everything (hardware to application)        | Full control                     |
| Standard RDS          | Hardware, OS, patches, backups, HA          | Application optimization                    | Limited (no OS/SSH access)       |
| Self-Managed on EC2   | Hardware only                               | OS management, patches, backups, HA, scaling  | Full control; high admin overhead|
| RDS Custom            | Hardware & underlying infrastructure        | Application optimization, customizations    | Middle ground (OS/SSH access available)|

6. Exam & Real-World Usage
--------------------------
- **For the Exam:** 
  - Understand that RDS Custom exists as a niche option and know its key differentiators.
- **Real-World:** 
  - Rarely encountered; useful when specific customization needs prevent using standard RDS.

7. Conclusion
-------------
- RDS Custom offers a compromise between the ease of standard RDS and the full control of self-managed databases on EC2.
- It provides increased customization and direct access while maintaining many AWS-managed benefits.
- Primarily supports Oracle and MS SQL, making it a niche solution for specialized use cases.
