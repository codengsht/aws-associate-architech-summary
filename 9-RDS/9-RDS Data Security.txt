9-RDS Data Security
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- RDS provides robust data security through:
  - Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
  - Encryption at rest (KMS/EBS encryption and TDE)
  - Authentication (local DB users and IAM-based options)
  - Authorization (managed by internal database permissions)
- These measures protect data both during transmission and while stored on disk.

2. Encryption in Transit
-------------------------
- **Mechanism:** SSL/TLS encryption
- **Details:**
  - Encrypts data between clients and the RDS instance.
  - Can be enforced on a per-user basis.
  - Ensures that sensitive information is securely transmitted over the network.

3. Encryption at Rest
---------------------
- **Mechanisms:**
  - **KMS & EBS Encryption:**
    - Data written by the DB engine is encrypted by the underlying host.
    - Utilizes AWS KMS to generate Customer Master Keys (CMKs) and Data Encryption Keys (DEKs).
    - Applies to the storage (EBS volumes), snapshots, logs, and replicas.
  - **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):**
    - Supported by Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle.
    - Encryption and decryption occur within the database engine.
    - Oracle can leverage CloudHSM for enhanced key control and regulatory compliance.
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Once enabled, encryption cannot be disabled.
  - All stored data—including backups and replicas—is uniformly protected.

4. Authentication
-----------------
- **Local Database Users:**
  - Default method using usernames and passwords.
- **IAM-Based Authentication:**
  - Configurable option that allows IAM roles/users to generate an authentication token (valid for 15 minutes) for logging into the database.
  - Requires a mapping between an IAM identity and a local database user.
- **Key Point:** IAM authentication is only for verifying identity; it must be explicitly enabled on the RDS instance.

5. Authorization
----------------
- **Mechanism:** Managed by local database user permissions and roles.
- **Details:**
  - Determines access levels to the database resources.
  - Remains independent of IAM-based authentication.
- **Key Point:** Although IAM can handle authentication, authorization is controlled internally by the database.

| Security Aspect       | Mechanism/Method                                               | Key Points                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encryption in Transit | SSL/TLS encryption                                             | Secures data between client and RDS; enforceable per user                    |
| Encryption at Rest    | KMS/EBS encryption; TDE (for MS SQL & Oracle, with CloudHSM option)| Uses CMKs/DEKs for storage encryption; applies to snapshots, logs, and replicas|
| Authentication        | Local DB users; IAM-based token authentication                 | IAM tokens (15 min validity) serve as an alternative to passwords            |
| Authorization         | Local DB permission management                                 | Controlled within the database; IAM affects only authentication              |
