9-RDS Read-Replicas
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- Read replicas are read-only copies of a primary RDS instance.
- They are used to improve read performance, enable cross-region failover, and achieve low recovery time objectives (RTO) in failure scenarios (excluding data corruption).

2. Key Concepts
---------------
- **Read-Only:** Read replicas are designed exclusively for handling read operations until they are manually promoted.
- **Separate Endpoints:** Each read replica has its own unique endpoint; applications must be configured to use these endpoints.
- **Asynchronous Replication:** Data is first committed to the primary instance and then asynchronously replicated to the read replicas, which may introduce a short lag.
- **No Automatic Failover:** Unlike standby replicas in Multi-AZ deployments, read replicas do not automatically take over if the primary fails.

3. Replication Methods
----------------------
- **Asynchronous Replication:** 
  - Data is written to the primary and then propagated to the read replicas.
  - This replication method can result in a slight delay (lag) depending on network conditions and workload.
- **Exam Note:** For RDS (excluding Aurora), remember that read replicas use asynchronous replication.

4. Benefits of Read Replicas
----------------------------
- **Read Scalability:** Up to five read replicas per primary instance can be created, each adding additional read capacity.
- **Global Performance:** Cross-region read replicas allow local access for users in different regions, reducing latency.
- **Disaster Recovery:** In a failure scenario (excluding data corruption), a read replica can be quickly promoted to serve as the new primary, offering near-zero Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and low RTO.

5. Limitations & Considerations
-------------------------------
- **Replication Lag:** The asynchronous nature may cause a slight delay in data replication; chaining replicas can exacerbate lag.
- **Manual Promotion:** Failover is not automatic; read replicas must be manually promoted during disaster recovery.
- **Application Support:** Applications must be designed or configured to recognize and use the separate endpoints of read replicas.
- **Data Corruption:** Since replicas mirror the primaryâ€™s data, any corruption in the primary will be replicated.

6. Use Cases
------------
- **Performance Optimization:** Offload read traffic from the primary instance to improve overall performance.
- **Cross-Region Resilience:** Deploy read replicas in other regions for better global availability and to reduce latency for geographically dispersed users.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly restore operations by promoting a read replica in the event of a primary instance failure (provided data corruption is not a factor).

7. Comparison Table: Attributes of RDS Read Replicas
-----------------------------------------------------

| Aspect           | Description                                                      | Key Considerations                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read-Only        | Operate only for read operations until promoted                  | Cannot handle writes unless manually promoted                 |
| Replication Type | Asynchronous replication from the primary                        | Potential replication lag; increases with chained replicas      |
| Endpoint         | Each replica has its own unique endpoint                           | Applications must be adjusted to use these endpoints           |
| Use Cases        | Enhance read scalability, global access, and disaster recovery     | Not suited for write operations or recovering from data corruption|
| Failover         | Requires manual promotion to become primary                        | No automatic failover capability                                |
| RPO/RTO          | Near-zero RPO and low RTO in failure scenarios                     | Effective for failures but not for handling data corruption      |

8. Conclusion
-------------
- RDS read replicas are vital for scaling read operations and bolstering disaster recovery strategies.
- They require careful management, with attention to replication lag, manual promotion processes, and application-level configuration.
- When used appropriately, read replicas offer significant performance and resilience benefits, especially in global or high-read environments.
