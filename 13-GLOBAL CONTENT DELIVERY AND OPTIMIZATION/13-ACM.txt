1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose:**  
  - ACM is an AWS service that manages digital certificates used for SSL/TLS encryption.  
  - It secures data in transit and enables server authentication for web applications.
  
- **Core Functions:**  
  - Issues and manages public certificates trusted by web browsers.
  - Can also operate as a private Certificate Authority (CA) for internal organizational needs.
  - Provides automated renewal for certificates that it issues (if generated by ACM), reducing administrative overhead.

2. Certificate Generation & Renewal
-------------------------------------
- **ACM-Generated Certificates:**  
  - Automatically renew before expiration.  
  - Requires domain ownership validation (via DNS or email).
  
- **Imported Certificates:**  
  - Must be manually renewed and re-imported.
  
- **Key Point:**  
  - Always prefer ACM-issued certificates when possible for automation and simplicity.

3. Service Integration & Deployment
-------------------------------------
- **Supported AWS Services:**  
  - Certificates from ACM can be deployed to AWS services that support ACM (e.g., CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancers, API Gateway).
  - **Not Supported:**  
    - Self-managed services such as EC2 (since they do not integrate with ACMâ€™s managed deployment).

- **Regional Constraints:**  
  - ACM is a regional service; certificates are bound to the region in which they are issued.
  - For most AWS services, the certificate must reside in the same region as the resource.
  - **CloudFront Exception:**  
    - CloudFront is a global service, but it always uses ACM certificates from the US East (N. Virginia) region.

4. Trust & Security
--------------------
- **Public vs. Private CAs:**  
  - **Public CA:**  
    - Certificates are trusted by default by web browsers through a chain of trust with established public CAs.
  - **Private CA:**  
    - Used for internal applications; clients must be configured to trust the private CA.
  
- **Storage & Deployment:**  
  - Certificates are stored encrypted within ACM.
  - Deployed securely to supported AWS services via managed integration.

5. Key Exam Points
------------------
- Understand the distinction between ACM-generated and imported certificates (automatic vs. manual renewal).
- Know that ACM is region-specific:
  - For most resources, the certificate must be in the same region as the resource.
  - CloudFront always uses certificates from US East (N. Virginia).
- Recognize that ACM supports only specific AWS services (e.g., not EC2).
- Be aware of the difference between public and private certificate authorities and their use cases.
