13-Cloudfront and SSL/TLS
==========================

1. Default Domain & Custom Domains
------------------------------------
- Each CloudFront distribution receives a default domain name (a random string ending in cloudfront.net) secured with a default SSL certificate.
- For custom domain names (via Alternate Domain Names), you must supply a matching SSL certificate.

2. SSL Certificate Requirements
-------------------------------
- Certificates must be publicly trusted (self-signed certificates are not accepted).
- To use a custom domain with HTTPS, you need an SSL certificate (typically managed via AWS Certificate Manager, ACM).
- **Regional Constraint:**  
  - For CloudFront, ACM certificates must be issued in US East (N. Virginia), regardless of where your distribution’s content originates.
- For origins (e.g., an Application Load Balancer or custom origin), a valid publicly trusted certificate matching the origin’s DNS name is required.

3. Viewer Protocol Policy & Origin Protocol
---------------------------------------------
- **Viewer Protocol Policy:**  
  - Controls how end users connect to CloudFront (allowing HTTP and HTTPS, redirecting HTTP to HTTPS, or enforcing HTTPS only).
- **Origin Protocol Policy:**  
  - Controls the connection between CloudFront and the origin server.
  - Both viewer and origin connections require valid SSL certificates and proper configuration to ensure secure data transfer.

4. SNI vs. Dedicated IP Addresses
-----------------------------------
- **SNI (Server Name Indication):**  
  - Allows multiple domains to share a single IP by sending the hostname during the TLS handshake.
  - Supported by modern browsers and available at no extra cost.
- **Dedicated IP Addresses:**  
  - Required for older browsers that do not support SNI.
  - Comes at an additional cost (e.g., approximately $600/month per distribution).

5. DNS, Custom Domain Setup, and Security
-------------------------------------------
- Custom domain names must point to the CloudFront distribution via DNS (using Route 53 or another provider).
- The SSL certificate must match the custom domain name.
- CloudFront leverages ACM for certificate management, ensuring certificates are automatically renewed (if issued by ACM).





6. Key Exam Points
------------------
- **Certificate Deployment:**  
  - CloudFront always uses ACM certificates from US East (N. Virginia), even if your content is hosted in another region.
- **Public Trust:**  
  - Both viewer and origin protocols must use publicly trusted certificates.
- **SNI vs. Dedicated IP:**  
  - Understand that SNI is free and suitable for modern browsers, while dedicated IP addresses incur extra cost for legacy support.
- **Origin Considerations:**  
  - S3 origins manage SSL internally and do not require custom certificates; custom origins and ALBs do require proper SSL setup.
