12-SQS Dead-Letter Queues
==========================

1. Purpose:
   - Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) help handle messages that repeatedly fail processing in an SQS queue.
   - They prevent endless reprocessing of problematic messages by isolating them for further analysis.

2. How It Works:
   - Each time a message is received but not deleted, its "receive count" increases.
   - A redrive policy is configured on the source queue specifying a "max receive count."
   - When a message's receive count exceeds the max count, it is automatically moved to the DLQ.

3. Benefits:
   - **Diagnostics:** Allows you to set alarms and examine problematic messages separately.
   - **Error Isolation:** Prevents a failing message from blocking the processing of other messages.
   - **Custom Processing:** Offers the option to apply alternative processing or manual review to problematic messages.

4. Important Considerations:
   - **Retention Periods:**
     - Messages in SQS have a retention period based on their original enqueue timestamp.
     - When moved to a DLQ, the original timestamp is retained.
     - Ensure DLQ retention is set longer than the source queueâ€™s retention period to allow sufficient time for analysis.
   - **Multiple Sources:**
     - A single DLQ can be used for multiple source queues if configured appropriately.
