12-SQS Standard vs FIFO Queues
========================================

1. Overview:
   - **Standard Queues:** 
     - Think of these as multilane highways.
     - Designed for high throughput and decoupling application components.
   - **FIFO Queues:** 
     - Think of these as single-lane highways.
     - Designed for preserving strict ordering and exactly-once processing.

2. Performance:
   - **Standard Queues:**
     - Scale virtually without throughput limitations.
     - Provide high transaction rates, handling a near-infinite number of messages.
   - **FIFO Queues:**
     - Limited throughput: approximately 300 messages per second without batching; up to 3000 messages per second with batching.
     - (Note: High-throughput mode is available in preview for FIFO queues.)

3. Message Ordering:
   - **Standard Queues:**
     - Best-effort ordering; messages may be delivered out of order.
   - **FIFO Queues:**
     - Guarantee strict first-in, first-out
