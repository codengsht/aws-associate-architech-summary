12-CloudWatchEvents and EventBridge
========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- The lesson focuses on CloudWatch Events and EventBridge, explaining how they deliver a near real-time stream of system events.
- These events capture changes in AWS services (e.g., EC2 instance state changes) and provide visibility into system activities.

2. Overview of Services
------------------------
- **CloudWatch Events:**
  - Provides real-time event streams from AWS services.
  - Captures events such as instance termination, start, or stop.
  - Uses a single, implicit default event bus per AWS account (not directly visible in the UI).

- **EventBridge:**
  - An evolution of CloudWatch Events with a superset of functionality.
  - Supports events from AWS services, third-party sources, and custom applications.
  - Recommended for new deployments due to its enhanced features and flexibility.

3. Core Components and Architecture
-------------------------------------
- **Event Bus:**
  - Both services operate using an event busâ€”a stream where events from supported sources are collected.
  - CloudWatch Events uses one default event bus, while EventBridge allows creation of additional custom event buses.
  
- **Rules:**
  - Rules are defined to pattern match events on the event bus.
  - **Pattern Matching Rules:** Trigger when incoming events match specific criteria.
  - **Scheduled Rules:** Use cron-like expressions to trigger at designated times.
  - When a rule matches an event, it routes the event to one or more specified targets (e.g., Lambda functions).

4. Use Cases and Functionality
------------------------------
- **Event Handling:**
  - Events include details like instance state changes, timestamps, and other metadata.
  - Targets (such as Lambda functions) consume event data to perform tasks.
  
- **Interoperability and Migration:**
  - Events created by CloudWatch Events and EventBridge are interoperable.
  - AWS encourages migration to EventBridge for new projects because of its extended capabilities.




5. Comparison Table: CloudWatch Events vs. EventBridge
-------------------------------------------------------
| Service           | Key Features                                                   | Additional Capabilities                | Best Practice for New Deployments        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CloudWatch Events | Real-time event stream; single implicit event bus              | Limited to AWS service events          | Suitable for legacy setups               |
| EventBridge       | Enhanced event routing; supports AWS, third-party, and custom events; flexible event bus management | Expanded integration and feature set | Recommended for new deployments          |

6. Conclusion
-------------
- Both CloudWatch Events and EventBridge provide mechanisms to capture and route system events.
- EventBridge offers additional features and supports a broader range of event sources, making it the preferred choice for new solutions.
- A solid understanding of these services is crucial for designing efficient, event-driven architectures in AWS.
