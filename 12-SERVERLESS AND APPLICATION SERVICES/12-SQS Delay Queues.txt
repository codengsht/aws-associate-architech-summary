12-SQS Delay Queues
======================

1. Introduction
---------------
- Delay Queues are an SQS feature that postpone the delivery of messages to consumers.
- Unlike Visibility Timeout—which hides a message after it’s received—Delay Queues keep messages invisible right after they are added to the queue.

2. SQS Message Processing Recap
-------------------------------
- **Message Lifecycle:**
  - A message is sent to the queue using the SendMessage operation.
  - Normally, it is immediately visible to consumers.
  - When a consumer calls ReceiveMessage, the message is returned and then hidden for a period (the Visibility Timeout) to allow processing.
  - If processing succeeds, the message is explicitly deleted. Otherwise, it reappears after the Visibility Timeout expires.
- **Visibility Timeout:**
  - **Default:** 30 seconds.
  - **Range:** 0 seconds to 12 hours.
  - Purpose: To enable automatic reprocessing of messages in case of processing failures.

3. Delay Queues
----------------
- **Definition:**
  - A Delay Queue delays the visibility of messages right after they are added.
  - During the configured delay period, messages remain invisible to consumers.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Delay Seconds (Queue Level):**  
    - Default is 0 seconds; set to a non-zero value to enable delay.
    - **Maximum:** 15 minutes.
  - **Message Timers (Per Message):**  
    - Can also set a delay on individual messages (0 to 15 minutes).
    - Not supported on FIFO (5 OQ) queues.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Intentionally delaying processing (e.g., waiting for prerequisite tasks to complete).
  - Adding a buffer time between an action and its subsequent processing.














4. Comparison: Delay Queues vs. Visibility Timeout
----------------------------------------------------
| Feature               | Delay Queues                                  | Visibility Timeout                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| When It Applies       | Immediately upon message insertion          | After a message is received by a consumer     |
| Purpose               | Postpone message availability                 | Prevent duplicate processing during work      |
| Default Value         | 0 seconds                                     | 30 seconds                                    |
| Maximum Value         | 15 minutes                                    | Up to 12 hours                                |
| Use Case              | Delaying processing intentionally             | Handling processing failures and retries      |

5. Conclusion
-------------
- Delay Queues enable you to introduce intentional delays in message processing.
- They differ fundamentally from Visibility Timeout, which is used to manage in-process message handling.
- Understanding both concepts is critical for designing robust SQS-based architectures and for exam success.
