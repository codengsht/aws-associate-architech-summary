12-Kinesis Data Analytics
==========================

1. Introduction
---------------
- Kinesis Data Analytics is a real time data processing service that enables you to run SQL queries on streaming data.
- It is part of the broader Kinesis family, which includes Kinesis Data Streams (for high-scale ingestion) and Kinesis Data Firehose (for near real time delivery).
- This service is ideal for scenarios requiring immediate, complex data manipulation using SQL.

2. Positioning Within the Kinesis Family
------------------------------------------
- **Kinesis Data Streams:**  
  - Designed for large-scale data ingestion with a rolling data retention window.
  - Provides real time access to data for consumers.
  
- **Kinesis Data Firehose:**  
  - Buffers and delivers data in near real time (e.g., ~60 seconds latency).
  - Supports simple transformations via Lambda.
  
- **Kinesis Data Analytics:**  
  - Processes streaming data in real time using SQL.
  - Can ingest data from Data Streams or Firehose.
  - Offers the ability to join streaming data with static reference data (from S3) for enrichment.

3. Core Architecture & Workflow
---------------------------------
- **Inputs:**
  - Ingests streaming data from either Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose.
  
- **In-Application Components:**
  - **Input Streams:**  
    - Virtual tables that mirror external data streams.
  - **Reference Data:**  
    - Optional static tables sourced from S3 to enrich streaming data.
  - **SQL Processing Engine:**  
    - Runs real time SQL queries on the input streams (and joins with reference data if needed).
  - **Output Streams:**  
    - Virtual tables where query results are sent; mapped to external destinations.
  - **Error Streams:**  
    - Captures any errors from SQL query processing.

- **Outputs:**
  - Results can be delivered to Kinesis Data Streams (preserving real time delivery) or to Kinesis Data Firehose (resulting in near real time delivery).



4. Key Features & Considerations
----------------------------------
- **Real Time Processing:**  
  - Enables immediate query processing on streaming data.
  - Maintains true real time performance if outputs are directed to Kinesis Data Streams or Lambda.
  
- **SQL-Based Transformation:**  
  - Use standard SQL to filter, aggregate, and transform data.
  - Supports complex processing compared to simple Lambda-based transformations in Firehose.
  
- **Cost Model:**  
  - You pay based on the volume of data processed.
  - It is not a low-cost option; best used for scenarios that justify real time, complex stream processing.

5. Use Cases
------------
- Real time analytics and dashboards (e.g., time series data, e-sports leaderboards).
- Real time monitoring and alerting (e.g., security metrics, IoT sensor data).
- Enriching streaming data by joining with static reference data stored in S3.
- Scenarios where complex SQL queries on streaming data are needed.

6. When to Choose Kinesis Data Analytics
------------------------------------------
- Use Kinesis Data Analytics when you need:
  - Immediate, real time processing of streaming data.
  - Complex data manipulation that goes beyond simple transformations.
  - The ability to integrate streaming data with static datasets for enrichment.
- Avoid it when:
  - Near real time processing (with slight delays) is acceptable, as Kinesis Data Firehose may suffice.
  - The workload does not justify the cost of real time SQL processing.
