12-AWS Lambda - PART 2
========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lecture covers advanced topics in AWS Lambda including networking modes, permissions, and monitoring.
- Emphasis is placed on understanding the architecture and configuration differences, which are critical for exam success.

2. Lambda Networking
---------------------
- **Two Networking Modes:**
  - **Public Networking (Default):**
    - Lambda functions run in a public AWS environment.
    - They have direct access to public AWS services (e.g., SQS, DynamoDB, RDS) provided proper authentication and authorization.
    - Benefits include best performance due to shared hardware and no customer-specific networking configuration.
    - Limitation: Cannot access private VPC resources unless those services have public addressing.
  
  - **VPC Networking:**
    - Lambda functions can be configured to run inside a VPC.
    - They obey standard VPC rules (security groups, network ACLs, routing) and can access other VPC resources.
    - By default, VPC-based functions do not have direct access to the internet or public AWS services.
      - To enable such access, you must configure VPC endpoints (e.g., gateway endpoints) or attach an internet gateway via a NAT or similar mechanism.
    - **ENI (Elastic Network Interface) Details:**
      - Historically, an ENI was created per function invocation, causing performance delays.
      - The new model creates one ENI per unique combination of subnets and security groups, significantly reducing startup latency.

- **Networking Comparison Table:**

| Networking Mode | Characteristics                                                    | Access                                                | Performance                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Public          | Default mode; runs on shared AWS infrastructure                    | Direct access to public AWS services                  | Optimal performance; minimal networking overhead       |
| VPC             | Configured within a VPC; follows VPC security and routing rules      | Can access private resources; needs endpoints for public access | Initially had ENI overhead; new model minimizes delays   |

3. Lambda Permissions
----------------------
- **Execution Role:**
  - An IAM role assumed by the Lambda function at runtime.
  - Grants permissions for the function to interact with other AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch Logs).
  - A prebuilt policy exists to ensure the function can log output to CloudWatch Logs.

- **Resource Policy:**
  - Controls who or what can invoke the Lambda function.
  - Functions similarly to an S3 bucket policy.
  - Configurable via CLI/SDK (not through the console UI), and can allow external AWS accounts or services to trigger the function.

- **Permissions Comparison Table:**

| Permissions Aspect | Description                                                                                   | Key Points                                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Execution Role     | IAM role assumed by the Lambda function during execution; grants AWS service access.           | Must include CloudWatch Logs permissions; typically set via a prebuilt policy. |
| Resource Policy    | Policy attached to the Lambda function that controls invocation rights.                       | Managed via CLI/SDK; similar to S3 bucket policies; defines who can trigger the function. |

4. Lambda Monitoring and Logging
----------------------------------
- **CloudWatch Logs:**
  - Captures all log output from Lambda executions, including error messages and execution details.
  - Essential for troubleshooting functions that aren’t producing expected logs (often due to missing permissions in the execution role).

- **CloudWatch Metrics:**
  - Stores key performance metrics (invocation counts, success/failure rates, latency, and retries).
  
- **AWS X-Ray:**
  - Provides distributed tracing capabilities.
  - Useful for tracking the execution path across services, though it may feature only lightly on the exam.
  - Remember: Terms like “X-Ray” and “distributed tracing” could be exam focal points.

5. Exam Power-Up Points
------------------------
- Understand the two Lambda networking modes:
  - **Public Networking:** Default, high performance, direct public access.
  - **VPC Networking:** Requires VPC configuration (subnets, security groups, endpoints) and behaves like any other VPC resource.
- Be aware of the evolution in ENI management that now minimizes performance delays for VPC-based functions.
- Remember the dual aspects of Lambda permissions:
  - **Execution Role:** Governs what AWS services the function can access.
  - **Resource Policy:** Controls who can invoke the function.
- Ensure that Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to log to CloudWatch Logs to aid in troubleshooting.
- Note the distinction between logging (CloudWatch Logs) and metrics (CloudWatch Metrics) as well as the additional tracing functionality provided by AWS X-Ray.
