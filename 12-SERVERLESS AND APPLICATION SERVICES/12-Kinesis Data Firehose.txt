12-Kinesis Data Firehose
=========================

1. Introduction
---------------
- Kinesis Data Firehose is part of the Kinesis family designed to deliver streaming data to various AWS destinations.
- Unlike Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose is a near real-time service with built-in buffering, not a true real-time processing tool.

2. Core Features & Functionality
----------------------------------
- **Data Ingestion & Delivery:**
  - Accepts data from producers directly or via Kinesis Data Streams.
  - Buffers incoming data until either a threshold of 1 MB or a time limit (default 60 seconds) is met before delivery.
  - Provides near real-time delivery (latency around 60 seconds), not sub-second real time.

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Supports on-the-fly data transformation using AWS Lambda.
  - Transformation can add extra latency; users can optionally back up the unmodified data.

- **Cost Model:**
  - Operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model based on the data volume processed.

3. Supported Destinations
-------------------------
- Firehose can deliver data directly to:
  - **Amazon S3:** For persistent, long-term storage.
  - **Amazon Redshift:** Delivered via an intermediate S3 bucket and copy command.
  - **Amazon Elasticsearch Service:** For search and analytics.
  - **Splunk:** For log analysis and monitoring.
  - **HTTP Endpoints:** To integrate with third-party services.

| Destination Type   | Notes                                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon S3          | Primary storage destination; persists data beyond streaming window |
| Amazon Redshift    | Data is first buffered in S3, then copied into Redshift        |
| Amazon Elasticsearch| For real-time search and analytics                           |
| Splunk             | Direct integration for log and event analysis                |
| HTTP Endpoints     | Enables integration with external systems via webhooks        |

4. Use Cases & Considerations
-----------------------------
- **Ideal for:**
  - Persisting streaming data beyond the transient window of Kinesis Data Streams.
  - Loading data into data lakes, warehouses, or analytics platforms.
  - Scenarios where a slight delay (near real time) is acceptable.
- **Key Consideration:**
  - Firehose is not suitable when true real-time processing (e.g., sub-200ms latency) is required.
  - Choose Kinesis Data Streams if immediate data availability is critical, then process with Lambda as needed.

5. Conclusion
-------------
- Kinesis Data Firehose simplifies the process of capturing and delivering large volumes of streaming data to various AWS services.
- Its near real-time buffering and automatic scaling make it a cost-effective solution for data persistence and analytics.
- Remember: It trades off real-time immediacy for ease of use and managed delivery, making it ideal for many batch-oriented and analytics applications.
