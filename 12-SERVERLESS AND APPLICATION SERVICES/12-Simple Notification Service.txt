12-Simple Notification Service
========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- SNS is a highly available, durable, and secure pub/sub messaging service on AWS.
- It uses public endpoints, making it accessible from anywhere with network connectivity.
- SNS is a fundamental component in many AWS architectures, supporting various AWS services and external integrations.

2. Core Concepts
----------------
- **SNS Topic:**  
  - The base entity where messages are published.
  - Topics control permissions and configuration.
- **Publishers:**  
  - Entities (applications or services) that send messages to an SNS topic.
- **Subscribers:**  
  - Endpoints that receive messages from an SNS topic.
  - Subscriber types include HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, email addresses, SQS queues, mobile push notifications, and AWS Lambda functions.

3. Key Features
---------------
- **Message Payload:**  
  - Supports messages up to 256 KB in size (designed for notifications, not large binary files).
- **Pub/Sub Delivery:**  
  - All subscribers receive messages by default (filters can be applied to restrict delivery).
- **Fan-Out Architecture:**  
  - A single SNS topic can fan out messages to multiple SQS queues or other subscribers.
  - Enables parallel processing of messages across different workloads.
- **Delivery Status & Retry:**  
  - Offers delivery status for certain subscriber types (HTTP/HTTPS, SQS, etc.).
  - Supports automatic retry mechanisms for reliable message delivery.
- **Security & Compliance:**  
  - Supports server-side encryption (SSE) for data at rest.
  - Uses topic policies (similar to S3 bucket policies) to manage cross-account access.

4. Architectural Overview
-------------------------
- SNS is a public AWS service operating from the AWS public zone.
- It integrates with AWS products (like CloudWatch alarms, CloudFormation, and Auto Scaling) to trigger notifications.
- SNS topics serve as central hubs for routing messages between publishers and subscribers.
- Custom event routing and filtering ensure that messages are delivered only to relevant subscribers.

5. Subscriber Types Comparison
------------------------------
| Subscriber Type              | Description                                              | Use Case Example                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS Endpoints         | Receives messages via webhooks                           | Triggering web services                   |
| Email                        | Sends notifications via email                            | Alert notifications                       |
| SQS Queue                    | Enqueues messages for asynchronous processing            | Decoupled backend processing              |
| Mobile Push Notifications    | Delivers messages as push notifications or SMS           | Mobile app alerts                         |
| AWS Lambda                   | Invokes a function with the message payload              | Serverless event processing               |

6. Conclusion
-------------
- SNS is essential for building loosely coupled, scalable architectures on AWS.
- Its integration with multiple subscriber types and managed services makes it a versatile tool for both internal and external communications.
- A thorough understanding of SNS is crucial for designing robust, event-driven systems that efficiently handle notifications and message delivery.
