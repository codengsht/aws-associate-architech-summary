6-Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
==============================================

Overview:
- This lecture provides a brief theoretical overview of the Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- The focus is on understanding the core architecture and features, with a promise of a practical demonstration later in the course.

Definition and Purpose:
- ECR is a managed container image registry service.
- It hosts and manages container images used in container-based applications (e.g., ECS, EKS).
- Acts as a repository system for container images, similar to source control systems like Git.

Registry Structure and Organization:
- Each AWS account is provisioned with:
  - One public registry
  - One private registry
- Within each registry:
  - Multiple repositories can be created.
  - Each repository can store numerous container images.
  - Container images are tagged, with tags needing to be unique within a repository.

Security Architecture:
- **Public Registry:**
  - Anyone can pull images (read-only access).
  - Pushing images (write access) requires proper permissions.
- **Private Registry:**
  - All operations (both read and write) require permissions.
- Access control is managed via AWS IAM.

Benefits and Features:
- **Security Scanning:**
  - Offers both basic and enhanced scanning (with enhanced scanning leveraging the Inspector product) to detect vulnerabilities in the OS and software packages within images.
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Provides near real-time metrics via CloudWatch (e.g., authentication events, push/pull operations).
  - Logs all API actions through CloudTrail.
  - Generates events for integration with event-driven workflows via EventBridge.
- **Replication:**
  - Supports replication of container images across regions and accounts.

Comparison of Registry Types:
| Aspect       | Public Registry               | Private Registry                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Read Access  | Open (anyone can pull)        | Requires permissions                 |
| Write Access | Requires permissions (push)   | Requires permissions for any action  |

Conclusion:
- The lecture covers the high-level theoretical aspects of ECR.
- Emphasizes understanding the structure, security, and operational benefits of using ECR.
- Indicates that a hands-on demo will follow later in the course to reinforce these concepts.
