10-AWS Backup
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- AWS Backup is a fully managed data protection service.
- It centralizes the management and storage of backups across multiple AWS services, accounts, and regions.
- It not only handles backup and restore operations but also offers auditing and policy management features.

2. Key Features
---------------
- **Centralized Management:**  
  - Consolidates backups from various services (e.g., EC2, EBS, EFS, FSx, RDS, Aurora, Neptune, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, S3) into one dashboard.
- **Cross-Account & Cross-Region:**  
  - Supports backup management across multiple AWS accounts and enables copying backups between regions for extra protection.
- **Backup Plans:**  
  - Schedule backups using defined frequencies (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) with options for custom cron expressions.
  - Configure backup windows and lifecycle policies (e.g., transition to cold storage, automatic expiry).
- **Continuous Backups & Point-in-Time Recovery:**  
  - For supported services, continuous backups enable restoration to a specific point in time.
- **Backup Vaults:**  
  - Backups are stored in secure backup vaults.
  - Vaults can be configured in immutable (WORM) mode, where a 72-hour cool-off period prevents deletion for compliance.
- **On-Demand Backups:**  
  - In addition to scheduled backups, you can perform backups on demand.

3. Core Components
------------------
- **Backup Plans:**  
  - Define how and when backups occur.
  - Allow customization of frequency, backup window, and retention lifecycle.
- **Backup Resources:**  
  - Specify the AWS resources (e.g., RDS instance, S3 bucket) to be backed up.
- **Backup Vaults:**  
  - Serve as the secure destination for storing backup data.
  - Support features like cross-region copying and WORM mode.
- **Region Copy:**  
  - Enables backup data to be replicated to another AWS region for disaster recovery.

4. Benefits & Use Cases
------------------------
- **Simplification:**  
  - Eliminates the need for custom scripts across different AWS services.
- **Compliance & Data Protection:**  
  - Centralizes backup policies and retention settings, aiding in compliance.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Enables rapid recovery across regions with configurable backup retention and point-in-time restore.
- **Multi-Service Coverage:**  
  - Integrates with a wide array of AWS services, making it a key tool for end-to-end data protection.
