14-VPC Peering
===============

1. Overview
-----------
- VPC Peering creates a private, encrypted network link between two VPCs.
- Each peering connection links exactly two VPCs—no more, no less.
- Peering can be established between VPCs in the same region or across regions, and can span different AWS accounts.
- Note: Peering connections are non-transitive (if VPC A is peered with VPC B, and VPC B with VPC C, A and C are not connected).

2. Key Concepts
---------------
- **Non-Transitivity:**  
  - Connectivity does not automatically extend beyond the two peered VPCs.  
  - To connect multiple VPCs (e.g., A, B, and C), each pair must have its own peering connection.
- **IP Address Management:**  
  - VPC CIDR blocks must not overlap; overlapping ranges prevent peering.
- **DNS Resolution:**  
  - VPC peering can support private DNS so that public DNS names resolve to private IP addresses.
- **Security Group Integration:**  
  - Within the same region, you can reference security groups by ID for peered VPCs.
  - Across regions, you must use IP addresses or CIDR blocks in security rules.

3. Architecture & Configuration
-------------------------------
- **Peering Connection:**  
  - Creates a logical gateway object in each VPC.
- **Routing Setup:**  
  - Update route tables in each VPC to direct traffic destined for the remote VPC’s CIDR block to the peering connection.
  - All subnets requiring access must have appropriate route table entries.
- **Security Configuration:**  
  - Ensure that security groups and network ACLs permit traffic between the peered VPCs.
- **Regional Considerations:**  
  - Cross-region peering is supported but may have additional configuration or performance considerations.

4. Use Cases & Considerations
------------------------------
- **Private Communication:**  
  - Enables secure communication between VPCs without exposing traffic to the public Internet.
- **Hybrid Architectures:**  
  - Useful for connecting VPCs across different AWS accounts or regions in multi-VPC deployments.
- **Limitations:**  
  - Connections are non-transitive; full mesh connectivity requires direct peering between every pair of VPCs.
  - Overlapping CIDR blocks in VPCs will block the establishment of a peering connection.

5. Key Exam Points
------------------
- VPC peering connects two VPCs only.
- Connectivity is non-transitive.
- VPC CIDR blocks must not overlap.
- Routing tables must be manually configured to direct traffic via the peering connection.
- Security groups (or IP/CIDR rules for cross-region) must allow traffic between the peered VPCs.
