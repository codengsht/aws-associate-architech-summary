14-Egress-Only Internet gateway
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- An egress-only internet gateway is used exclusively for IPv6 traffic in a VPC.
- It allows IPv6-enabled instances to initiate outbound connections to the Internet and receive response traffic.
- It blocks any unsolicited inbound traffic from the Internet.

2. IPv4 vs. IPv6 Context
------------------------
- **IPv4:**  
  - Private IPv4 addresses require a NAT gateway for outbound Internet access.
- **IPv6:**  
  - All IPv6 addresses in AWS are publicly routable.
  - An egress-only internet gateway provides a mechanism similar to a NAT gateway for IPv6, enabling outbound connectivity while preventing inbound connections.

3. Key Functionality
--------------------
- **Outbound-Only Access:**  
  - Permits instances to connect out and receive responses.
- **Security:**  
  - Prevents external systems from initiating connections to your IPv6-enabled instances.
- **High Availability:**  
  - Like standard internet gateways, egress-only gateways are highly available and scale automatically.

4. Configuration
----------------
- **Creation & Attachment:**  
  - Create the egress-only internet gateway and attach it to your VPC.
- **Routing:**  
  - Update the subnet route tables for IPv6 by adding a default route (destination ::/0) that points to the egress-only internet gateway.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for workloads that require IPv6 connectivity for outbound requests (e.g., software updates, external API calls) without exposing instances to inbound Internet traffic.

5. Key Exam Points
------------------
- Understand that egress-only internet gateways are specific to IPv6.
- Know that they allow outbound traffic while blocking unsolicited inbound connections.
- Recognize that configuration involves attaching the gateway to the VPC and setting the appropriate IPv6 default route (::/0) in the route table.
- Remember: For IPv6 in AWS, if you need NAT-like functionality (outbound-only), you use an egress-only internet gateway.
