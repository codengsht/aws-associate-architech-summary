14-VPC Flow Logs
=================

1. Overview
-----------
- VPC Flow Logs capture metadata about IP traffic within a VPC.
- They do NOT capture packet contents; for content capture, a packet sniffer is required.
- Useful for monitoring, security analysis, and troubleshooting network issues.

2. Captured Data
----------------
- **Metadata Includes:**
  - Source and destination IP addresses.
  - Source and destination port numbers.
  - Protocol number (e.g., ICMP=1, TCP=6, UDP=17).
  - Packet size, timestamps, and action (ACCEPT or REJECT).
  
3. Levels of Logging
--------------------
- **VPC-Level:**  
  - Captures data from all network interfaces across all subnets in the VPC.
- **Subnet-Level:**  
  - Captures data from every network interface within a specific subnet.
- **ENI-Level:**  
  - Captures data for a specific Elastic Network Interface only.

4. Timing and Destinations
---------------------------
- **Delay:**  
  - Flow logs are not real-time; expect a delay before the data is available.
- **Destinations:**  
  - Logs can be sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for integrated monitoring.
  - Alternatively, logs can be delivered to Amazon S3, which allows direct file access and querying (e.g., using Athena).

5. Important Considerations
---------------------------
- **Security Groups vs. Network ACLs:**
  - Security groups are stateful; typically one log entry covers both inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Network ACLs are stateless; separate log entries may be generated for inbound and outbound flows.
- **Excluded Traffic:**  
  - Certain traffic, such as requests to the EC2 metadata service and communications with the Amazon Windows license server, are not captured.
- **Usage:**  
  - Ideal for retrospective analysis of network traffic and diagnosing connectivity or security issues.
