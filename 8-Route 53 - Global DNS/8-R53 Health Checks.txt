8-R53 Health Checks
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces the health check feature in Route 53, essential for advanced DNS architectures.
- Emphasizes that health checks are managed separately from DNS records and performed by globally distributed checkers.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Health Check Fundamentals:**
  - Independently created and managed outside of DNS records.
  - Used to evaluate the operational status of endpoints accessible via the public Internet.
- **Types of Health Checks:**
  - **Endpoint Checks:** Directly monitor the health of a specified endpoint (by IP address or domain name).
  - **CloudWatch Alarm Checks:** Base the health status on CloudWatch alarms.
  - **Calculated Checks:** Aggregate multiple health check results to derive an overall health status.
- **Check Mechanisms:**
  - **TCP Checks:** Attempt to establish a TCP connection (must succeed within 10 seconds).
  - **HTTP Checks:** Establish a TCP connection (within 4 seconds) and expect a 200/300 status code within 2 seconds.
  - **HTTP/HTTPS with String Matching:** In addition to status codes, the response must include a specified string within the first 520 bytes.
- **Configuration & Management:**
  - Health checks run every 30 seconds by default, with an option to increase frequency to every 10 seconds.
  - Advanced options include setting failure thresholds, customizing the request interval, latency graphs, region selection, and even inverting health check results.
  - Integration with SNS for notifications on health check failures.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Global Distribution:** Health checks are performed by a fleet of checkers worldwide, ensuring broad and reliable monitoring.
- **Independence from DNS Records:** Health checks exist separately and can be linked to multiple DNS records to influence traffic routing.
- **Impact on DNS Responses:** Only healthy endpoints are returned in DNS queries, which helps maintain application availability.
- **Configuration Nuances:** Adjusting parameters like TTL and failure thresholds can help balance between responsiveness and avoiding false positives.

Examples & Case Studies
-------------------------
- **Console Walkthrough:**
  - Demonstrated creating a health check in the Route 53 console by specifying parameters like IP/domain, port, protocol, and request path.
  - Showed advanced settings such as string matching and regional configuration.
- **Architectural Use Case:**
  - Illustrated how health checks ensure that DNS responses exclude endpoints that are reported unhealthy by a majority of global checkers.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Route 53 health checks are vital for ensuring that only healthy endpoints receive DNS traffic.
- Proper configuration is crucial; adjust intervals and failure thresholds to suit your applicationâ€™s needs.
- Integrate health checks with SNS and CloudWatch to enable proactive monitoring and rapid response to outages.
- Understanding and leveraging the different types of health checks (endpoint, CloudWatch, calculated) is key to building a resilient infrastructure.
