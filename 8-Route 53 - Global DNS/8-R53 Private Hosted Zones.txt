8-R53 Private Hosted Zones
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces private hosted zones as a counterpart to public hosted zones within Route 53.
- Explains that private hosted zones function similarly to public zones but are accessible only within associated VPCs.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Private Hosted Zones:**
  - Operate like public hosted zones but restrict DNS resolution to VPCs.
  - Can be associated with VPCs via the console, CLI, or API, even across different accounts (API/CLI only).
- **DNS Record Management:**
  - Resource records are created within the zone, just as in public hosted zones.
  - Provides a secure way to manage internal DNS records.
- **Split Horizon (Split View) DNS:**
  - Allows the creation of both public and private hosted zones using the same domain name.
  - Enables different DNS responses: internal users see the full set of records, while external users receive a limited view.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Access Control:**
  - Only VPCs associated with the private hosted zone can resolve its records.
  - VPCs not associated or public users cannot access these private DNS records.
- **Security & Isolation:**
  - Ideal for sensitive resources that should remain accessible only within an organizationâ€™s network.
- **Dual DNS Views:**
  - Split horizon DNS supports running the same domain name with separate public and private record sets, ensuring internal systems can have exclusive configurations.

Examples & Case Studies
-------------------------
- **Internal vs. Public Record Sets:**
  - Example scenario: A private hosted zone holds records for internal services like an accounting system, while a public hosted zone for the same domain offers only general website information.
- **VPC-Based Access:**
  - Demonstrates how only VPCs associated with the private hosted zone can resolve and access sensitive internal records.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Private hosted zones are essential for securing DNS records intended solely for internal use.
- The split horizon DNS technique is recommended when the same domain must serve both public and private needs.
- Ensure proper VPC associations to maintain control over which resources can access the private DNS records.
