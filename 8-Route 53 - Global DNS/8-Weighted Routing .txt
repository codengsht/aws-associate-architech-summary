8-Weighted Routing
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces weighted routing as a method for simple load balancing and testing new software versions in Route 53.
- Uses DNS records with assigned weights to control the distribution of traffic.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Record Configuration:**
  - Hosted zone contains multiple WWW A records pointing to different endpoints (e.g., EC2 instances).
  - Each record is assigned a specific weight (e.g., 40, 40, 20) to determine its share of DNS responses.
- **Weight Calculation:**
  - The total weight is the sum of all record weights.
  - Each record’s probability of being returned is calculated as its weight divided by the total weight.
  - Setting a record’s weight to zero prevents it from being returned.
- **Health Check Integration:**
  - Weighted routing can be combined with health checks.
  - If a record selected based on its weight is unhealthy, the process repeats until a healthy record is chosen.
  - Health checks do not alter the overall weight calculation; they only skip over unhealthy endpoints.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Load Distribution:**
  - Traffic is distributed based on the ratio of each record’s weight to the total.
  - This is useful for both balancing load and gradually testing new versions by directing a specific percentage of traffic.
- **Controlled Traffic Flow:**
  - Allows precise management of DNS responses, ensuring that only healthy endpoints are used.
  - Ideal for scenarios where incremental changes or blue/green deployments are required.

Examples & Use Cases
---------------------
- **Software Rollout:**
  - For instance, directing 5% of traffic to a new server version by assigning it a lower weight compared to stable endpoints.
- **Traffic Management:**
  - Distributing requests among multiple servers based on predetermined weights to optimize resource usage.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Weighted routing provides a straightforward DNS-based load balancing solution.
- It is particularly effective when testing new versions or controlling traffic distribution across several endpoints.
- Combining weighted routing with health checks enhances reliability by ensuring traffic is only directed to healthy resources.
