8-Implementing DNSSEC using Route53
==============================================
Overview
--------
- This lesson explains how to enable and implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) in Route 53.
- DNSSEC enhances the integrity and authenticity of DNS data by digitally signing DNS records, establishing a chain of trust from the parent zone down to individual resource records.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Enabling DNSSEC in Route 53:**
  - Can be activated via the Route 53 console UI or CLI.
  - The process begins with the creation of an asymmetric key pair using AWS KMS (Key Management Service), which must be generated in the US East (N. Virginia) region.
- **Key Generation and Signing Process:**
  - **Key Signing Key (KSK):** An asymmetric KMS key is used to generate the public and private parts. These keys conceptually form the KSK.
  - **Zone Signing Key (ZSK):** Created internally by Route 53 (without KMS involvement) to sign the zone’s DNS records.
  - Both the public KSK and ZSK are published as DNSKEY records within the hosted zone.
  - The private KSK is used to create RRSIG (Resource Record Signature) records for DNSKEY records, enabling resolvers to verify the integrity of the zone data.
- **Establishing the Chain of Trust:**
  - A DS (Delegation Signer) record is generated (a hash of the public KSK) and must be added to the parent zone (e.g., the .org registry) to link the child zone’s DNSSEC configuration to the global DNS hierarchy.
  - For domains registered with Route 53, this update can be automated through the registrar console; if registered elsewhere, it must be configured manually.
- **Monitoring and Validation:**
  - It is recommended to set up CloudWatch alarms for DNSSEC failures (e.g., internal validation issues or KSK problems).
  - Optionally, enabling DNSSEC validation ensures that records failing signature verification are not returned to clients.

Key Concepts
------------
- **DNSSEC Fundamentals:** Provides cryptographic assurance that DNS responses have not been tampered with.
- **Separation of Duties:** Distinguishes between the registrar function (registering the domain) and DNS hosting (managing zone files), even though both are often provided together by Route 53.
- **Key Management:** Emphasizes that the KMS-generated KSK must reside in US East (N. Virginia), while the ZSK is managed internally by Route 53.
- **Chain of Trust:** The DS record in the parent zone is critical for establishing trust between the public DNS system and the signed zone.

Examples & Use Cases
---------------------
- **Demonstration with a Sample Domain:**
  - Using a domain (e.g., animalsforlife.org), the process begins by enabling DNSSEC on the hosted zone.
  - The console walkthrough shows creating the KSK with a KMS key, waiting for propagation, and verifying the presence of DNSKEY and RRSIG records using command-line tools (like dig).
  - The subsequent update of the DS record in the parent (.org) zone completes the chain of trust.
- **Operational Considerations:**
  - Timing is crucial—changes must account for TTL values to ensure proper propagation.
  - Automated notifications via CloudWatch can alert administrators to any issues with DNSSEC signatures.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Enabling DNSSEC in Route 53 significantly enhances the security of your DNS infrastructure by ensuring data integrity and authenticity.
- Follow the proper sequence: generate keys using KMS, enable DNSSEC to publish DNSKEY and RRSIG records, and update the DS record in the parent zone.
- Monitor the DNSSEC configuration with CloudWatch alarms and consider enabling DNSSEC validation to protect against invalid responses.
- Ensure all prerequisites (such as TTL considerations) are met to avoid disruption during the transition.
