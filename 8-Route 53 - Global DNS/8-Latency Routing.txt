8-Latency Routing
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces latency-based routing in Route 53 as a method to optimize performance and enhance user experience.
- Aimed at directing users to the infrastructure with the lowest latency, thereby improving application responsiveness.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Hosted Zone and Record Setup:**
  - Uses a hosted zone containing multiple A records (e.g., WWW) with each record tied to a specific AWS region (e.g., US East 1, US West 1, AP Southeast 2).
  - Only one record per region is allowed for latency-based routing.
- **Latency Determination:**
  - AWS maintains a real-time database of latencies between its regions and users around the world.
  - When a DNS query is received, Route 53 uses an IP lookup to determine the userâ€™s location and selects the record from the region with the lowest latency.
- **Health Check Integration:**
  - Latency routing can be combined with health checks.
  - If the selected (lowest latency) record is unhealthy, Route 53 automatically chooses the next best (lowest latency) healthy record.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Ensures that DNS queries are answered with the endpoint that provides the best performance based on geographical latency.
- **Real-Time Latency Data:**
  - The underlying latency database is continuously updated, although it may not account for localized network issues.
- **Health-Driven Failover:**
  - Incorporates health checks to ensure that users are only directed to healthy and responsive endpoints.

Examples & Use Cases
---------------------
- **Global Application Performance:**
  - A user in Australia might be routed to an endpoint in AP Southeast 2 if that region offers the lowest latency compared to US-based endpoints.
- **Improved User Experience:**
  - Ideal for applications with a global user base where performance is critical.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Latency-based routing significantly improves application performance by directing users to the fastest available endpoint.
- Combining this routing policy with health checks ensures reliability by avoiding unhealthy endpoints.
- Recommended for global applications where minimizing latency is essential for optimal user experience.
