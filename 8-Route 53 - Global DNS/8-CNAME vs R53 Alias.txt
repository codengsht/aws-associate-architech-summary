8-CNAME vs R53 Alias
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Explains the differences between traditional CNAME records and AWS-specific alias records in Route 53.
- Highlights why alias records are necessary, particularly for apex (naked) domains.

Main Topics
-----------
- **CNAME Records:**
  - Map one domain name to another.
  - Work well for subdomains (e.g., www.example.com) but cannot be used for the domain apex.
- **Alias Records:**
  - AWS-specific records that map a domain to an AWS resource.
  - Can be used for both subdomains and naked domains.
  - Come in A record or CNAME record variants, matching the underlying resource's record type.
- **Integration with AWS Services:**
  - Essential when pointing to AWS resources (like ELBs, API Gateway, CloudFront, etc.) that don’t provide static IP addresses.
  - AWS encourages alias records by offering free requests when they point to AWS services.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Limitation of CNAME:**
  - Cannot be used at the domain apex, limiting its applicability.
- **Benefits of Alias Records:**
  - Overcome the restrictions of CNAME records.
  - Allow seamless DNS mapping for both naked domains and subdomains.
  - Provide cost benefits and optimal routing for AWS-hosted resources.
- **AWS Proprietary Nature:**
  - Alias records are a non-standard extension available only when using Route 53 for DNS hosting.

Examples & Case Studies
-------------------------
- **Apex Domain Example:**
  - For a domain like categram.io (naked domain), a CNAME record isn’t supported; an alias record must be used to point to an AWS resource.
- **Subdomain Example:**
  - For subdomains like www.categram.io, both CNAME and alias records can be used, but alias records are preferred for AWS integrations.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Default to using alias records for AWS resources, particularly for apex domains.
- Leverage alias records to benefit from AWS’s cost-free query advantages when pointing to AWS services.
- Remember that alias records are AWS-specific and require hosting on Route 53.
