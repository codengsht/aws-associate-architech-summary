8-Multi Value Routing
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces multi-value routing as an advanced Route 53 routing policy that blends aspects of simple and failover routing.
- Designed to improve application availability by actively returning only healthy endpoints.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Record Configuration:**
  - Multiple DNS records with the same name (e.g., multiple WWW records) can be created.
  - Each record is typically an A record mapping to an IP address.
- **Health Check Integration:**
  - Each record can have an associated health check.
  - Only healthy records are returned in response to DNS queries.
- **Response Behavior:**
  - Up to eight healthy records are returned to the client.
  - If more than eight healthy records exist, eight are selected at random.
  - The client then chooses one of these returned records to connect to.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Active-Active Routing:**
  - Unlike failover routing (active-passive), multi-value routing supports multiple active resources.
  - Improves availability by distributing requests among several healthy endpoints.
- **DNS-Based Load Distribution:**
  - Provides a way to balance traffic using DNS without replacing a dedicated load balancer.
- **Contrast with Other Routing Policies:**
  - Simple routing lacks health checks and is typically used for a single resource.
  - Failover routing is used for backup scenarios, while multi-value routing is suited for environments with many viable resources.

Examples & Use Cases
---------------------
- **Scenario Example:**
  - Three WWW records are configured for a domain.
  - Each record is health checked, ensuring that only the healthy ones are returned.
  - This setup is ideal when you have several resources capable of serving requests and you want DNS to distribute traffic randomly among them.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Use multi-value routing when you have multiple resources that can handle client requests.
- It enhances availability by ensuring that only healthy endpoints are provided to users.
- While it improves DNS-level load distribution, it does not replace the need for a traditional load balancer.
