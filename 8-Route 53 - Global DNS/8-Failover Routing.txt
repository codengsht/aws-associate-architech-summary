8-Failover Routing
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces Route 53 failover routing as the second routing policy.
- Designed to enable active-passive configurations by using primary and secondary records.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Record Configuration:**
  - Within a hosted zone (e.g., for the WWW record), two records of the same name are defined.
  - One record is marked as primary and the other as secondary.
- **Health Check Integration:**
  - A health check is associated with the primary record.
  - When the primary record passes the health check, DNS queries return its value.
  - If the primary fails, DNS queries are directed to the secondary record.
- **Use Case Example:**
  - A common scenario is an out-of-band failure architecture:
    - Primary resource: an EC2 instance.
    - Secondary resource: an S3 bucket used as a failover.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Active-Passive Failover:**
  - Traffic is normally routed to the active (primary) resource.
  - Automatic switch to the passive (secondary) resource occurs upon failure.
- **Health-Driven Routing:**
  - The effectiveness of failover routing relies on continuous health monitoring.
  - Ensures high availability by preventing traffic from reaching unhealthy endpoints.

Examples & Case Studies
-------------------------
- **Practical Implementation:**
  - Primary record for WWW directs to an EC2 instance.
  - Secondary record for WWW directs to an S3 bucket, activated if the primary fails.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Use failover routing for environments requiring active-passive redundancy.
- Ensure proper configuration of health checks to enable smooth automatic failover.
- Consider this routing policy when maintaining high availability is critical.
