8-Simple Routing
==============================================
Overview
--------
- Introduces the simplest routing policy in Route 53.
- Describes how simple routing is the default option for directing DNS queries.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Basic Operation:**
  - Simple routing is used within a hosted zone (e.g., animalsforlife.org) to manage DNS records.
  - Only one record per name is created; for example, a WWW record using an A record type.
- **Response Mechanism:**
  - When a client queries the record, all associated values are returned in random order.
  - The client then selects one value to connect to the corresponding server.
- **Ideal Use Case:**
  - Best suited for directing traffic to a single service, such as a web server.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Simplicity:**
  - Provides straightforward DNS routing without additional complexities.
- **Limitations:**
  - Does not support health checks to verify that the target resource is operational.
  - Lacks the routing intelligence of other Route 53 policies that incorporate health monitoring.

Examples & Case Studies
-------------------------
- **Web Server Example:**
  - A simple routing policy is applied to the WWW record in a public hosted zone.
  - Multiple IP values may be returned, but no health check is performed to confirm service availability.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- Simple routing is effective for basic DNS setups where advanced features are not required.
- For environments needing enhanced reliability and resource verification, consider other routing policies that support health checks.
