7-EC2 Instance Roles & Profile
==============================================

Overview
--------
- The lecture explains how EC2 instance roles allow AWS services to securely grant permissions to other AWS services.
- It emphasizes that roles are the best practice for providing temporary credentials to applications running on EC2 instances, avoiding long-term credential storage.

Main Topics
-----------
- **IAM Roles and Permissions**
  - IAM roles define a set of permissions through an attached policy.
  - When a service or instance assumes a role, it receives temporary security credentials with the permissions granted by that policy.

- **EC2 Instance Roles**
  - EC2 instances can assume IAM roles, allowing any application running on the instance to use the temporary credentials.
  - These credentials are delivered via the instance metadata service, ensuring that applications have continuous, valid access as they are automatically rotated.

- **Instance Profiles**
  - An instance profile acts as a wrapper for an IAM role.
  - It is the mechanism by which the roleâ€™s credentials are passed into the EC2 instance.
  - When using the AWS Management Console, an instance profile is automatically created with the same name as the role; however, separate creation may be required when using the CLI or CloudFormation.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Temporary Credentials and Rotation**
  - When an EC2 instance assumes a role, temporary credentials are generated.
  - These credentials are automatically renewed before expiration via interactions between EC2 and the secure token service.

- **Security Best Practices**
  - It is recommended to use instance roles rather than embedding long-term credentials (access keys) within the instance.
  - Tools such as the AWS CLI automatically utilize these temporary credentials when an instance role is attached.

- **Access via Instance Metadata**
  - Applications retrieve the temporary credentials from the instance metadata under a dedicated IAM tree.
  - This ensures that any application running on the instance can securely access AWS resources (like S3) using the provided credentials.

Examples & Case Studies
------------------------
- **Role Usage Example:**
  - An EC2 instance with an attached instance profile can automatically provide its applications with the necessary permissions to interact with other AWS services.
  - AWS CLI and SDKs within the instance detect and use these credentials without additional configuration.

- **Security Implementation:**
  - By using instance roles, organizations avoid the risk associated with storing long-term credentials on the instance.
  - This practice reduces potential security vulnerabilities and simplifies credential management.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- **Adopt Instance Roles:**
  - Always use IAM roles for EC2 instances to leverage temporary credentials and enhance security.
  - Avoid storing static access keys on instances to minimize exposure.

- **Understand the Architecture:**
  - Recognize that the instance profile is essential for delivering role credentials into the EC2 instance.
  - Ensure that applications check the instance metadata for updated credentials to maintain uninterrupted access.

- **Practical Usage:**
  - Leverage AWS tooling that automatically uses instance role credentials for seamless and secure operations.
  - Integrate this practice into all deployments to adhere to AWS best practices and improve overall security posture.
