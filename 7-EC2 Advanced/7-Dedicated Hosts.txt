7-Dedicated Hosts
==============================================

Overview
--------
- Dedicated Hosts are a feature of EC2 that provide you with an entire physical server exclusively for your use.
- They are primarily used in scenarios such as enterprise software licensing, where software costs are based on physical hardware attributes.
- For exam purposes, it is important to know that Dedicated Hosts exist and understand their basic architectural and pricing concepts.

Main Topics
-----------
- **Definition and Purpose**
  - A Dedicated Host is a physical server allocated to your AWS account.
  - You pay for the entire host capacity rather than per-instance fees, which can benefit software licensing models.
  
- **Pricing Models**
  - Hosts can be purchased On-Demand for short-term or uncertain requirements.
  - For predictable, long-term needs, reservations (with one- or three-year terms, and various upfront payment options) are available.

- **Hardware and Capacity**
  - Dedicated Hosts are designed for specific instance families (e.g., A1, C5, M5) and come with a fixed number of physical sockets and cores.
  - This capacity determines how many instances (of a fixed size) can be run on the host.
  - Non-Nitro dedicated hosts require you to pre-set the instance size (e.g., 16 A1 medium instances, eight large, etc.).
  
- **Flexibility with Nitro-Based Hosts**
  - Newer Nitro-based Dedicated Hosts (such as R5 or C5) allow mix-and-match of different instance sizes up to the host's total core capacity.
  - This increased flexibility can maximize host utilization when your workload has varying instance size requirements.

- **Limitations and Sharing**
  - Certain AMIs (like some Linux/Windows versions) and features (e.g., placement groups) are not supported on Dedicated Hosts.
  - Dedicated Hosts can be shared among different AWS accounts within an organization using AWS Resource Access Manager, with clear visibility and control separation.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Dedicated Allocation:** The entire physical server is exclusively reserved for your use, allowing you to manage software licensing based on the actual hardware.
- **Fixed Capacity vs. Flexibility:** Traditional Dedicated Hosts offer fixed instance sizes, while Nitro-based hosts allow a mix of sizes.
- **Cost Efficiency:** You pay for the host capacity upfront; any instances launched on the host incur no additional instance charges.
- **Use Case Specificity:** Their primary value is in addressing software licensing requirements and not general-purpose compute needs.

Examples & Use Cases
---------------------
- **Fixed Configuration Example:** An A1 Dedicated Host with one socket and 16 cores might support 16 A1 medium instances, eight large, or other fixed configurations.
- **Flexible Configuration Example:** An R5 Dedicated Host (Nitro-based) can support a combination of instance sizes (e.g., one 2xlarge, one 4xlarge, and four 2xlarge) as long as the total core limit isn’t exceeded.
- **Licensing Scenarios:** Ideal for applications where enterprise licensing is based on physical hardware (sockets/cores), ensuring you only pay once for the host hardware.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- **For Exam Purposes:** Understand that Dedicated Hosts exist as a specialized offering with limited use cases—primarily for addressing software licensing challenges.
- **Deployment Considerations:** Recognize that these hosts are tied to specific instance families and fixed configurations unless using Nitro-based options.
- **Limitations to Note:** Dedicated Hosts do not support all features (like placement groups) and come with restrictions on instance sizing.
- **Practical Use:** Use Dedicated Hosts when your workload has specific licensing or compliance requirements; otherwise, standard EC2 instance provisioning offers greater flexibility.
