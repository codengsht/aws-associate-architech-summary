7-System and Application Logging on EC2
==============================================

Overview
--------
- This lesson explains how to capture internal system and application logs on an EC2 instance.
- It highlights the limitations of native CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs, which only monitor external-facing metrics.
- The solution involves installing and configuring the CloudWatch Agent to access OS-level performance metrics and log files.

Main Topics
-----------
- **CloudWatch Limitations**
  - CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs do not natively capture data from inside an EC2 instance.
  - Internal metrics like process details, memory consumption, and internal log files remain hidden without additional configuration.

- **Role of the CloudWatch Agent**
  - The CloudWatch Agent must be installed on the EC2 instance to collect internal operating system metrics and logs.
  - It gathers data such as application logs, system logs, and other performance counters, then sends this data to CloudWatch.

- **Configuration and Permissions**
  - **Configuration:** The agent requires a configuration file that specifies which metrics and log files to collect. This configuration can be centrally managed using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
  - **Permissions:** An IAM role with the proper permissions to interact with CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs must be attached to the instance. This avoids the need to use long-term credentials.
  
- **Log Organization**
  - Logs are organized into log groups in CloudWatch Logs.
  - Each log file to be captured is assigned a separate log group, and each instance writes to its own log stream within that group.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Internal Monitoring:** To gain visibility into OS-level processes and resource usage, the CloudWatch Agent is essential.
- **Security Best Practices:** Use IAM roles for providing temporary credentials instead of embedding static access keys on the instance.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Leveraging Parameter Store for managing the CloudWatch Agent’s configuration ensures consistency and scalability across multiple instances.
- **Automation at Scale:** Manual setup works for a single instance, but automating the process (e.g., with CloudFormation) is recommended for larger deployments.

Examples & Case Studies
------------------------
- **Single Instance Setup:**
  - Manually install the CloudWatch Agent on an EC2 instance.
  - Configure the agent with a file that defines which logs and metrics to capture.
  - Attach an IAM role with permissions to interact with CloudWatch services.
  
- **Automated Deployment:**
  - Use CloudFormation templates to deploy the CloudWatch Agent and associated IAM roles and configurations across many EC2 instances.
  - Store the agent configuration in Parameter Store for centralized management and ease of updates.

Conclusions & Recommendations
-------------------------------
- **Deploy the CloudWatch Agent:** Essential for capturing internal metrics and logs that are not available through CloudWatch by default.
- **Use IAM Roles:** Ensure secure, temporary credentials are provided to the agent, eliminating the risks associated with long-term credential storage.
- **Centralize Configuration:** Utilize Parameter Store to manage and distribute the CloudWatch Agent’s configuration, facilitating scalable deployments.
- **Plan for Automation:** Consider automating the installation and configuration process (e.g., via CloudFormation) for consistent deployment across multiple instances.
