15-Storage Gateway - Tape (VTL)
========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
• This lesson covers Storage Gateway running in tape mode (Virtual Tape Library – VTL mode).
• The focus is on how VTL mode integrates traditional tape backup processes into AWS.
• It’s important for the exam to understand when to use VTL mode versus other Storage Gateway modes.

2. Tape Backup Overview
-----------------------
• **Traditional Tape Backup Concepts:**
  - **Tape Media:**  
    - Uses tapes (e.g., LTO – Linear Tape-Open) that store large amounts of data sequentially.
    - Example: LTO9 can store up to 24 TB (uncompressed) or 60 TB (compressed) per tape.
  - **Tape Drive & Tape Loader:**  
    - Tape drives read/write tapes; tape loaders (robots) manage the insertion and ejection of tapes.
  - **Tape Library & Tape Shelf:**  
    - A tape library houses drives, loaders, and slots for storing tapes.
    - A tape shelf refers to offsite storage where tapes are kept when not in active use.
• **Challenges with Physical Tape Systems:**
  - High capital and operational costs (equipment purchase, maintenance, licensing, staffing).
  - Manual handling and physical transport between primary and offsite storage locations.
  
3. Storage Gateway in Tape (VTL) Mode
-------------------------------------
• **Core Functionality:**
  - Acts as a virtual tape library (VTL) to replace traditional physical tape libraries.
  - Runs as a virtual appliance (or hardware appliance) on-premises.
  - Presents virtual tape drives and media changers to the backup server over iSCSI.
• **Data Flow & Storage:**
  - **Local Cache:**  
    - Frequently accessed data is cached locally for fast, low-latency access.
  - **AWS Integration:**  
    - Backups are uploaded asynchronously to the Storage Gateway endpoint in AWS.
    - Data is stored in two main AWS-managed areas:
      • **Virtual Tape Library (VTL):**  
        - Data is stored as virtual tapes in S3.
      • **Virtual Tape Shelf (VTS):**  
        - Exported tapes (archived tapes) are moved to AWS Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive, providing scalable, long-term archival storage.
• **Virtual Tape Characteristics:**
  - Virtual tapes can range in size from 100 GB to 5 TB (aligned with S3 object size limits).
  - A single Storage Gateway appliance can manage up to 1 PB of data across approximately 1,500 virtual tapes.

4. Architectural Comparison: Physical Tape vs. VTL Mode
--------------------------------------------------------

| Component/Aspect         | Physical Tape Backup                                   | Storage Gateway in VTL Mode                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Tape Hardware            | Physical tape drives, loaders, and libraries           | Virtualized tape drives and media changers via VTL   |
| Data Storage             | Tapes stored locally, with offsite tape shelves        | Primary backup in AWS (S3); archives in Glacier/VTS   |
| Data Access              | Sequential access; slower retrieval; manual management | Local cache for hot data; asynchronous upload; managed by AWS |
| Cost & Maintenance       | High capex/opex and operational overhead               | Lower operational costs; cloud-managed scalability    |
| Scalability              | Limited by physical capacity                           | Scalable to petabytes; virtually unlimited archival storage |

5. Use Cases & Benefits
-----------------------
• **Maintain Existing Backup Systems:**  
  - Integrates seamlessly with existing backup software without major changes.
• **Cost Savings:**  
  - Reduces capital expense and maintenance costs associated with physical tape libraries.
• **Data Center Extension & Migration:**  
  - Enables backup data to be migrated to AWS; supports disaster recovery by leveraging AWS storage.
• **Extended Archival Storage:**  
  - Uses Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive for long-term, cost-effective retention of infrequently accessed data.

6. Exam Power Up Points
------------------------
• **Mode Identification:**  
  - If a question involves traditional tape backup scenarios or asks about legacy tape integration, VTL mode is typically the correct answer.
• **Key Advantages:**  
  - Understand that VTL mode maintains the appearance and functionality of a physical tape library while moving the heavy storage backend to AWS.
• **Data Flow:**  
  - Emphasize the asynchronous upload of backups from the on-premises gateway to the AWS-managed virtual tape library and, upon export, to the virtual tape shelf.
• **Capacity & Scalability:**  
  - Remember the key figure: up to 1 PB per gateway and 1,500 virtual tapes, with flexible archival via Glacier.

7. Conclusion
-------------
• Storage Gateway in tape (VTL) mode transforms traditional tape backup architecture by virtualizing tape drives and libraries.
• It enables organizations to continue using proven backup methodologies while benefiting from AWS’s scalable, cost-effective, and highly available storage.
• For exam scenarios involving tape backup integration, VTL mode is the go-to solution, particularly in use cases like backup, disaster recovery, and data migration where eliminating physical tape logistics is advantageous.
