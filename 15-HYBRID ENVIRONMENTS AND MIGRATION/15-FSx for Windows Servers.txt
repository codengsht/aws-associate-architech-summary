15-FSx for Windows Servers
===============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lecture covers AWS FSx for Windows File Server, an AWS managed service designed to provide native Windows file shares.
- FSx is part of AWS’s suite of services for Windows environments, addressing past limitations in Windows support.
- The focus is on understanding FSx’s architecture, features, and exam-relevant details, especially its differentiation from Linux-based file systems (like EFS).

2. Overview of FSx for Windows File Server
-------------------------------------------
- **Purpose:** Provides fully managed, native Windows file servers (file shares) without the overhead of managing your own Windows servers.
- **Key Features:**
  - Fully native Windows file system – not an emulated version.
  - Integrates with both managed and self-managed Active Directory (on-premises or in AWS).
  - Supports industry-standard Windows protocols (SMB) for file access.
  - Offers advanced Windows features such as deduplication, Distributed File System (DFS), and Volume Shadow Copies (VSS) for file-level restores.
  - Provides robust backup options including both automated and on-demand backups with at‐rest encryption via KMS and enforced encryption in transit.

3. Architectural Overview
-------------------------
- **Deployment Options:**
  - Can be deployed in single Availability Zone (AZ) mode with in–AZ replication or in multi–AZ mode for full high availability.
  - Supports connections via VPN, AWS Direct Connect, and VPC peering, allowing integration into complex corporate networks.
- **Integration:**
  - Uses Active Directory for its user store—either a managed AD service from AWS or an on-premises AD—to authenticate and manage access.
  - Once deployed, file shares are accessed using standard Windows UNC paths (e.g., \\[FileSystemID].domain\ShareName).
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - High performance with throughput ranging from megabytes per second up to two gigabytes per second.
  - Delivers hundreds of thousands of IOPS with latency under 1 millisecond.

4. Exam Power-Up Points
-----------------------
- **Identify Keywords:** When examining exam questions, look for terms like:
  - **Native Windows file system:** Indicates FSx (as opposed to EFS, which is geared toward Linux).
  - **SMB Protocol:** FSx uses SMB, while EFS uses NFS.
  - **Active Directory Integration:** FSx can integrate with both managed and on-premises AD.
  - **VSS and DFS:** Unique Windows features such as Volume Shadow Copies (for file restore) and DFS (for scalable file sharing).
  - **Deployment Mode:** Recognition of single-AZ versus multi-AZ deployments and integration with corporate networks.
- **Usage Differentiation:**
  - **FSx:** Ideal for Windows environments needing advanced file services, native permission handling, and seamless AD integration.
  - **EFS:** Suited for Linux-based workloads and shared file systems on Linux/UNIX instances.
