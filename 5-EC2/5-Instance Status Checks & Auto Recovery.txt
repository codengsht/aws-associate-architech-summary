5-Instance Status Checks & Auto Recovery
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lesson covers EC2 instance status checks and the auto recovery feature.
- Every EC2 instance is monitored via two key status checks: the System Status Check and the Instance Status Check.

2. Instance Status Checks
-------------------------
- **System Status Check:**
  - Monitors the underlying AWS infrastructure (host hardware, power, network connectivity).
  - Failures may indicate issues such as hardware problems, network interruptions, or power loss on the EC2 host.
  
- **Instance Status Check:**
  - Evaluates the health of the instance itself (operating system, file system, network configuration).
  - Failures may indicate OS-level issues like file system corruption or misconfigured network settings.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - An instance should eventually show "2/2 passed" for both checks.
  - Any failure in these checks signals a problem that needs attention.

3. EC2 Auto Recovery
--------------------
- **Purpose:**
  - Automatically recover an instance that fails a system status check.
  
- **How It Works:**
  - Auto recovery is configured using CloudWatch alarms tied to the status checks.
  - When triggered, EC2 will either reboot the instance or migrate it to a new host within the same Availability Zone.
  - The instance retains its configuration and private IP address during the recovery process.

4. Setup & Operation
--------------------
- **Configuration Steps:**
  - Create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors one or both of the status checks.
  - Define the alarm action to "recover" the instance upon a failure (after a specified period, e.g., one 5-minute interval).
  
- **Operational Behavior:**
  - If a status check fails continuously for the defined period, the auto recovery action is triggered.
  - The instance is then automatically recovered, either through a reboot or migration to a healthy host.

5. Limitations & Considerations
-------------------------------
- **Instance Requirements:**
  - Auto recovery works only with modern instance types that have EBS volumes attached (not with instance store volumes).
  
- **Capacity Dependencies:**
  - Recovery relies on available spare capacity within the same Availability Zone.
  - It does not protect against failures that impact an entire Availability Zone.

- **Scope of Recovery:**
  - Auto recovery is intended for isolated failures (host or instance level) and is not a substitute for high availability across multiple AZs.

6. Conclusion
-------------
- Monitoring EC2 status checks is essential for proactive instance health management.
- The auto recovery feature provides an automated way to mitigate isolated instance or host failures, reducing downtime.
- Proper configuration of CloudWatch alarms and understanding the limitations of auto recovery ensures a more resilient EC2 environment.
