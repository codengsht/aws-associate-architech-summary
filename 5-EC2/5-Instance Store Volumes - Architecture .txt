5-Instance Store Volumes - Architecture 
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lesson covers instance store volumesâ€”a type of storage provided with certain EC2 instances.
- Instance store volumes offer extremely high performance but come with significant tradeoffs regarding data persistence.

2. What are Instance Store Volumes?
------------------------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Instance store volumes are raw block storage devices directly attached to an EC2 host.
  - They appear to the operating system as disks on which file systems can be created.
- **Physical Attachment:**  
  - Unlike network-attached storage (EBS), these volumes reside on the physical hardware of the host.
- **Launch Requirement:**  
  - They must be attached at instance launch; you cannot add them after the instance is running.

3. Key Characteristics and Use Cases
--------------------------------------
- **Performance:**  
  - Provide the highest storage performance in AWS, with superior throughput and IOPS compared to EBS.
  - Examples include storage optimized instances like D3 (up to 4.6 GB/s) and I3 (up to 16 GB/s, with millions of IOPS).
- **Cost Efficiency:**  
  - Included in the price of the instance, so there is no additional charge for using them.
- **Ephemeral Nature:**  
  - Data on instance store volumes is temporary:
    - Lost if the instance is stopped, restarted, or migrated to a different host.
    - Also lost in case of hardware failures on the host.

4. Tradeoffs and Limitations
----------------------------
- **Advantages:**
  - Exceptional performance (low latency, high IOPS, high throughput).
  - Cost-effective as they are bundled with the instance pricing.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Ephemeral storage: Data is not persistent and is lost upon instance stop/start, host migration, or hardware failure.
  - Must be defined at launch; cannot be added or reattached later.
  - Not suitable for storing critical or irreplaceable data.

5. Summary Table: Pros and Cons of Instance Store Volumes
----------------------------------------------------------
| Aspect              | Instance Store Volumes                                       | Considerations                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Attachment          | Must be attached at launch; cannot be added later            | Plan storage needs during instance launch         |
| Persistence         | Ephemeral; data lost on host migration, stop/start, or failure | Not for critical or long-term data                |
| Performance         | Extremely high throughput and IOPS                           | Ideal for temporary, high-performance workloads   |
| Cost                | Included with the instance pricing                           | No extra cost but trade off with data persistence   |
| Usage Scenarios     | Caching, temporary storage, scratch data                     | Use only for non-critical, replaceable data       |

6. Conclusion
-------------
- Instance store volumes deliver unmatched local storage performance within AWS.
- They are best suited for workloads where temporary, high-speed data access is needed (e.g., caches, scratch space).
- Their ephemeral nature means they are not suitable for persistent or critical data.
- Understanding these tradeoffs is essential for designing effective AWS architectures and succeeding on the AWS exams.
