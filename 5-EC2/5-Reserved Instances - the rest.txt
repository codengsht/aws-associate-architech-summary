5-Reserved Instances - the rest
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- EC2 purchase options determine how you pay for compute capacity.
- They impact cost, capacity allocation, and hardware isolation.
- Key options include various types of Reserved Instances, Capacity Reservations, Dedicated Hosts/Instances, and Savings Plans.

2. Standard Reserved Instances
------------------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Long-term (1- or 3-year) commitment for 24/7/365 usage.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Lowest per-second pricing for continuous, predictable workloads.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for mission-critical components that must run continuously.

3. Scheduled Reserved Instances
-------------------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Reservations for recurring, but not continuous, usage.
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Specify frequency, duration, and specific time windows (e.g., 5 hours per day).
  - Minimum commitment of 1,000 hours per year with a 1-year term.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Best for predictable tasks that only run during certain hours or days (e.g., batch processing or back-end jobs).

4. Capacity Reservations
------------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Reserve EC2 capacity in a specific Availability Zone without a long-term billing commitment.
- **Key Points:**  
  - Provides guaranteed capacity during high-demand events or major failures.
  - Can be purchased as either regional (billing benefit only) or zonal (reserves capacity in a specific AZ).
  - You pay for the reserved capacity regardless of usage.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Critical workloads that cannot tolerate interruption when capacity is scarce.

5. Dedicated Hosts
------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Entire physical EC2 host dedicated exclusively to your account.
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - You pay for the host; instances launched on the host incur no additional per-second charge.
  - Suitable for meeting licensing requirements based on physical cores or sockets.
  - You must manage capacity manually; unused host capacity is wasted.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Environments with strict licensing or compliance requirements needing full hardware isolation.

6. Dedicated Instances
----------------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Instances that run on hardware isolated to your account, without managing the underlying host.
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Offers physical isolation similar to Dedicated Hosts, but without the need to manage host capacity.
  - Typically incur an extra fee compared to shared on-demand instances.
- **Use Case:**  
  - When isolation from other customers is required but host management is not desired.

7. Savings Plans
----------------
- **Definition:**  
  - Flexible pricing model where you commit to a fixed hourly spend over 1 or 3 years.
- **Types:**  
  - **General Compute Savings Plan:** Applies across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda (up to 66% savings).
  - **EC2 Savings Plan:** Specific to EC2 with higher discounts (up to 72% savings).
- **Mechanism:**  
  - You receive discounted rates on usage up to your committed hourly spend; any usage beyond that is billed at on-demand rates.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for organizations with predictable overall compute spending, especially if using multiple compute services.

8. Comparison Table: EC2 Purchase Options
------------------------------------------
| Purchase Option             | Commitment & Duration                | Capacity/Cost Benefit                                      | Key Use Cases                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Reserved Instances | 1 or 3 years, continuous use         | Lowest cost for 24/7/365 usage                             | Mission-critical, always-on workloads                  |
| Scheduled Reserved Instances| Minimum 1 year; scheduled hours only | Discounts for fixed recurring schedules                    | Batch jobs, periodic processing (e.g., 5 hrs/day)      |
| Capacity Reservations       | No long-term billing discount        | Guarantees capacity in a specific AZ; paid regardless of use | Critical workloads needing guaranteed capacity         |
| Dedicated Hosts             | Pay per host; long-term commitment   | Full hardware isolation; meets physical licensing needs    | Software with per-socket/core licensing requirements   |
| Dedicated Instances         | Additional fee; managed by AWS       | Physical isolation without host management overhead        | Isolation requirements without managing host capacity  |
| Savings Plans               | 1 or 3 years; fixed hourly spend     | Broad discounts across EC2 (or compute services) up to 66â€“72%| Flexible if using multiple AWS compute services        |

9. Conclusion
-------------
- **Default Strategy:**  
  - Start with On-Demand for unpredictable or short-term needs.
- **For Predictable, Continuous Workloads:**  
  - Use Standard Reserved Instances to secure the lowest cost.
- **For Scheduled, Non-Continuous Tasks:**  
  - Opt for Scheduled Reserved Instances to match specific time windows.
- **To Guarantee Capacity:**  
  - Consider Capacity Reservations if your workload is critical during high-demand periods.
- **For Strict Hardware Isolation:**  
  - Choose Dedicated Hosts or Dedicated Instances based on your management preferences.
- **For Flexible Cost Optimization:**  
  - Savings Plans offer a versatile way to reduce compute costs across multiple services.
- Understanding these options and their tradeoffs is essential for designing cost-effective, resilient AWS architectures and for success on the AWS exams.
