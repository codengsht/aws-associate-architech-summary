5-Amazon Machine Images (AMI) 
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- AMIs are the images (templates) used to launch EC2 instances.
- They capture an instance’s configuration, including the operating system, applications, and associated storage (via EBS snapshots).
- Despite debates over pronunciation, AMIs are simply the blueprints for EC2 instances.

2. What are AMIs?
-----------------
- AMIs provide a reproducible template for launching EC2 instances.
- AWS offers several sources:
  • AWS-provided AMIs (e.g., Amazon Linux)
  • Community-provided AMIs (e.g., Red Hat, CentOS)
  • Marketplace AMIs (which may include commercial software and licensing costs)
- AMIs are a key mechanism for standardizing deployments across your environment.

3. AMI Life Cycle and Customization
-------------------------------------
- **Lifecycle Phases:**
  1. **Launch:** Start with an existing AMI to create an EC2 instance.
  2. **Configure:** Customize the instance by installing software, modifying configurations, etc.
  3. **Create Image:** Generate a new AMI from the configured instance. This process captures the instance state and creates EBS snapshots for attached volumes.
  4. **Launch Again:** Use the newly created AMI to launch additional instances with the same configuration.
- This process, often referred to as “AMI baking,” allows you to deploy preconfigured, consistent environments at scale.

4. AMI Architecture and Block Device Mapping
-----------------------------------------------
- **Block Device Mapping:**
  - When creating an AMI from an instance, EBS snapshots are taken for each attached volume.
  - The AMI stores a mapping that links each snapshot to its original device name (e.g., /dev/xvda for the boot volume).
  - When a new instance is launched from the AMI, these snapshots are used to re-create and attach EBS volumes with the same device configuration.
- **Data Capture:**
  - Only the used portion of an EBS volume is captured (not the entire allocated size), and subsequent snapshots are incremental.

5. Regional and Permission Considerations
-------------------------------------------
- **Regional Scope:**
  - AMIs are region-specific. Each region has its own set of AMIs, even for the same operating system.
  - The snapshots referenced in an AMI are stored in S3 within that region.
- **Permissions:**
  - AMIs can be:
    • **Private:** Accessible only to your account.
    • **Public:** Made available to all AWS users.
    • **Shared with Specific Accounts:** Permissions can be granted to selected AWS accounts.

6. AMI Baking and Usage Scenarios
-----------------------------------
- **AMI Baking:**
  - Involves configuring an instance (installing software, setting up configurations) and then creating an AMI from that instance.
  - This “baked” AMI can be used to quickly deploy multiple instances with a standardized environment.
- **Usage Scenarios:**
  - Deploying consistent server environments.
  - Scaling out applications with preconfigured instances.
  - Migrating custom configurations between environments or regions by copying AMIs.

7. Billing Considerations
-------------------------
- **Snapshot Storage Costs:**
  - AMIs reference EBS snapshots, and you are billed for the actual data stored (used data), not the total volume size.
  - Since snapshots are incremental, only changed data between snapshots consumes additional storage.

8. Conclusion
-------------
- AMIs are a foundational component in AWS for creating, replicating, and managing EC2 instance configurations.
- They streamline the deployment of custom environments, enforce consistency, and facilitate rapid scaling.
- Understanding AMI lifecycle, block device mapping, regional limitations, and permission settings is critical for both practical AWS usage and for exam success.
