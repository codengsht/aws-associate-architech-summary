5- EC2 Purchase Options - PART 1 & 2
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- EC2 purchase options (officially termed “purchase options”) determine how you pay for EC2 instances.
- They impact cost, capacity reservation, and hardware isolation.
- The primary options include On-Demand, Spot, Reserved Instances, Dedicated Hosts, and Dedicated Instances.

2. On-Demand Instances
----------------------
- **Characteristics:**
  - Default purchase option with no long-term commitment.
  - Instances run on shared EC2 hosts.
  - Billing is per second while the instance is running.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads or when starting an evaluation.
  - Best when you cannot tolerate interruptions (though on-demand itself is not interrupted).
- **Limitations:**
  - No capacity reservation; in major failures or capacity shortages, on-demand has lower priority.

3. Spot Instances
-----------------
- **Characteristics:**
  - Leverages spare EC2 capacity offered at a significant discount (up to 90% off on-demand prices).
  - Prices vary dynamically; you bid a maximum price.
  - Instances are terminated if the spot price exceeds your bid.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Suitable for batch jobs, scientific computing, media processing, and other interruption-tolerant, parallelizable tasks.
- **Limitations:**
  - Not suitable for critical or long-term workloads due to potential interruptions.

4. Reserved Instances
---------------------
- **Characteristics:**
  - Long-term commitment (1 or 3 years) in exchange for a lower per-second cost.
  - Reservations can be tied to a specific Availability Zone (reserving capacity) or to a region.
  - Payment options include All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Ideal for core, steady-state workloads that run continuously.
- **Considerations:**
  - Commit to consistent usage; unused reservations still incur charges.
  - Can provide partial discounts if instance sizes differ.

5. Dedicated Hosts
------------------
- **Characteristics:**
  - Entire physical EC2 host dedicated exclusively to your account.
  - You pay for the host itself, not per instance.
  - Provides complete control over hardware allocation.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Required for software licensing based on physical sockets or cores.
  - Ideal when you need to ensure no other customers share your hardware.
- **Considerations:**
  - Capacity must be managed manually; any unused host capacity is wasted.

6. Dedicated Instances
-----------------------
- **Characteristics:**
  - Instances run on hardware dedicated to your account, but you do not manage the underlying host.
  - Offers physical isolation without the complexity of managing host capacity.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Suitable for organizations with strict compliance or isolation requirements.
- **Considerations:**
  - Typically incur an additional fee compared to shared on-demand instances.

7. Comparison Table: EC2 Purchase Options
------------------------------------------
| Purchase Option      | Cost & Commitment             | Capacity & Isolation                      | Ideal Use Cases                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| On-Demand            | Pay per second; no commitment | Shared hardware; no capacity reservation  | Short-term, unpredictable, or non-critical workloads |
| Spot                 | Highly discounted; bid-based  | Shared capacity; subject to interruption  | Batch processing, parallel tasks, cost-sensitive, interruption-tolerant workloads |
| Reserved Instances   | 1- or 3-year commitment; payment options (All/Partial/No Upfront) | Shared hardware; capacity reservation if AZ-specific | Long-term, steady-state workloads requiring cost predictability |
| Dedicated Hosts      | Pay for entire host           | Full hardware isolation; capacity managed by you | Licensing requirements based on physical hardware; strict isolation needs |
| Dedicated Instances  | Higher cost premium           | Physically isolated; no host management   | Workloads needing isolation without managing host capacity |

8. Conclusion
-------------
- **Default Strategy:**  
  - Begin with On-Demand as your baseline option.
- **Cost-Sensitive and Interruption-Tolerant Workloads:**  
  - Consider Spot Instances for substantial savings.
- **Long-Term, Consistent Workloads:**  
  - Reserved Instances offer predictable pricing and capacity.
- **Strict Isolation Requirements:**  
  - Choose Dedicated Hosts for full control or Dedicated Instances for physical isolation without host management.
- **Exam Tip:**  
  - Focus on understanding On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot purchase options, as they are most commonly featured on exams.
