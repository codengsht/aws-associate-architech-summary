1. Introduction
---------------
- EBS encryption secures data at rest on EBS volumes and snapshots by encrypting it before it is written to disk.
- It enhances data security by mitigating risks associated with physical storage attacks.

2. How EBS Works Without Encryption
-------------------------------------
- By default, EBS volumes store data in plaintext exactly as written by the operating system.
- Data (e.g., files, images) is stored on one or more physical disks without any encryption applied.

3. How EBS Encryption Operates
------------------------------
- **Key Management Service (KMS):**
  - EBS encryption uses AWS KMS to manage keys.
  - A KMS key (either AWS-managed or customer-managed) is used to generate a unique data encryption key (DEK) for each volume created from scratch.
- **Encryption Process:**
  - When an encrypted volume is created, EBS calls KMS (using the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext API) to generate an encrypted DEK.
  - The encrypted DEK is stored with the volume on the raw storage.
  - At the time of use (e.g., when the instance mounts the volume), KMS decrypts the DEK, and the decrypted key is loaded into the memory of the EC2 host.
  - Data is then encrypted/decrypted in transit between the EC2 host and the EBS volume using AES-256.
- **Lifecycle of the DEK:**
  - The decrypted DEK exists only in memory on the host during active use.
  - When an instance is migrated (stopped, restarted, or moved to another host), the decrypted key is discarded; only the encrypted DEK remains on disk.
- **Snapshots:**
  - Snapshots taken of an encrypted volume are also encrypted using the same DEK.
  - Any volume created from an encrypted snapshot remains encrypted.

4. Key Points for Security and Exam Scenarios
-----------------------------------------------
- **Default Encryption Settings:**
  - AWS accounts can be configured to encrypt all new EBS volumes by default.
  - You can choose a default AWS-managed KMS key or specify a customer-managed KMS key.
- **Uniqueness of Data Encryption Keys:**
  - A new, unique DEK is generated for every new EBS volume created from scratch.
  - Volumes created from snapshots reuse the DEK from the source volume.
- **Immutability of Encryption:**
  - Once a volume or snapshot is encrypted, it cannot be converted to unencrypted; the only workaround is to copy data at the OS level.
- **Transparency to the Operating System:**
  - The encryption/decryption process is transparent to the operating system; it always sees data in plaintext.
  - For additional encryption at the OS level (software disk encryption), separate configuration is required.
- **Cost and Performance:**
  - EBS encryption is provided at no additional cost and does not impact performance.

5. Comparison: Unencrypted vs. Encrypted EBS Volumes
------------------------------------------------------
| Attribute               | Unencrypted EBS Volume                         | Encrypted EBS Volume                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Data at Rest            | Stored in plaintext on physical disks        | Encrypted using AES-256 before storage       |
| Key Management          | No key management required                     | Managed via AWS KMS (AWS-managed or customer-managed) |
| Snapshots               | Snapshots are unencrypted                      | Snapshots are encrypted with the same DEK    |
| Data Persistence        | Vulnerable to physical storage attacks         | Protects against unauthorized physical access|
| Performance Overhead    | No encryption overhead                         | No measurable performance loss               |
| Cost                    | Standard EBS pricing                           | Same cost as unencrypted volumes             |

6. Conclusion
-------------
- EBS encryption is essential for securing sensitive data at rest without additional cost or performance degradation.
- It integrates seamlessly with AWS KMS, ensuring that each volume and its snapshots are uniquely secured.
- Understanding the encryption architecture and key lifecycle is critical for both real-world security implementations and AWS exam success.
