5-Network Interfaces, Instance IPs and DNS
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- EC2 instances come with robust networking features managed through Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
- Understanding ENIs, IP addressing, and DNS resolution is essential for designing secure and scalable architectures, as well as for exam success.

2. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)
--------------------------------------
- **Primary ENI:**
  - Every EC2 instance launches with a primary ENI.
  - It includes a MAC address and a primary private IPv4 address.
  - Security groups are applied directly to this interface.
- **Secondary ENIs:**
  - Optional additional interfaces that can be attached to an instance.
  - Can reside in different subnets (within the same Availability Zone) to allow for distinct security group assignments or network segmentation.
  - Can be detached and reattached to other instances if needed.

3. IP Addressing on ENIs
------------------------
- **Private IPv4 Address:**
  - Assigned from the subnet’s CIDR block.
  - Static for the instance’s lifetime.
- **Public IPv4 Address:**
  - Dynamically assigned if enabled; managed via the Internet Gateway.
  - Not configured within the instance’s OS (the OS only sees the private IP).
  - Changes when the instance is stopped/started or when migrated between hosts.
- **Elastic IP Address (EIP):**
  - A static public IPv4 address allocated to your AWS account.
  - When associated with a private IP on an ENI, it replaces the dynamic public IP.
  - If removed, a new dynamic public IP is assigned; the original IP cannot be recovered.
- **IPv6 Addresses:**
  - Can be attached to an ENI.
  - All IPv6 addresses are publicly routable; there is no concept of private IPv6 addressing.

4. DNS Resolution
-----------------
- **Private DNS:**
  - Associated with the instance’s primary private IPv4 address.
  - Typically formatted as “ip-&lt;private-ip-with-hyphens&gt;.ec2.internal”.
  - Resolvable only within the VPC.
- **Public DNS:**
  - For external access, resolves to the public IPv4 address.
  - Within the VPC, the same DNS name resolves to the primary private IPv4 address to keep traffic internal.
  - This dual behavior simplifies instance discoverability in hybrid network designs.

5. Security Groups and Source/Destination Checks
--------------------------------------------------
- **Security Groups:**
  - Applied directly to ENIs; they govern inbound and outbound traffic for all associated IP addresses.
  - Using multiple ENIs allows you to apply different security groups for different types of traffic (e.g., management vs. data).
- **Source/Destination Check:**
  - Can be enabled or disabled per ENI.
  - When enabled, only traffic with a source or destination matching the ENI’s assigned IPs is allowed.
  - Must be disabled for instances acting as NAT or routers.

6. Exam Tips
------------
- **Memorize Key Details:**
  - The metadata URL for instance metadata is fixed (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data).
  - The OS only configures the private IPv4 address; public IPv4 addresses are handled by the Internet Gateway.
  - Public DNS names resolve to private IP addresses internally and to public IP addresses externally.
- **Practical Considerations:**
  - Use secondary ENIs for scenarios needing separate security groups or static MAC addresses (useful for legacy licensing).
  - Understand that assigning an Elastic IP replaces the dynamic public IP; once removed, a new dynamic public IP is issued.

7. Conclusion
-------------
- EC2 networking is centered around ENIs, which hold all critical network attributes.
- Mastering these concepts ensures you can design flexible, secure architectures and excel in AWS certification exams.
