5-EC2 Architecture and Resilience
===========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lesson dives into the detailed architecture of the EC2 (Easy 2) product.
- EC2 is highlighted as a frequently used service with many exam questions focused on it.
- The focus is on understanding how EC2 instances, hosts, and related resources are organized.

2. EC2 Instance Architecture
----------------------------
- **EC2 Instances**: 
  - Virtual machines that include an operating system and allocated resources (virtual CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
  - May include additional hardware access (networking, GPUs).

- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Instances come with virtualized resources, which can be local (instance store) or remote (Elastic Block Store).

3. EC2 Hosts: Shared vs. Dedicated
-----------------------------------
- **EC2 Hosts** are the physical servers managed by AWS on which instances run.
- There are two types:
  - **Shared Hosts**: 
    - Hardware is shared across different AWS customers.
    - Users pay based on instance usage, with complete isolation between customers.
  - **Dedicated Hosts**: 
    - The entire physical host is dedicated to one customer.
    - Payment is for the entire host, with no resource sharing with other customers.

-------------------------
Comparison: Shared vs. Dedicated Hosts
-------------------------
| Aspect         | Shared Hosts                                              | Dedicated Hosts                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Ownership      | Shared among multiple AWS customers                       | Exclusively assigned to a single customer              |
| Payment Model  | Pay per instance usage based on allocated resources       | Pay for the entire host regardless of instance usage    |
| Isolation      | Full isolation despite shared physical hardware         | No sharing; dedicated physical resources                |

4. Availability Zone (AZ) Importance
--------------------------------------
- **AZ Confinement**:
  - Every EC2 host, along with its networking and storage (EBS), is tied to a single availability zone.
  - Subnets and EBS volumes are also confined to specific AZs.
- **Impact on Resilience**:
  - An AZ failure affects all hosts and instances within that zone.
  - Designing for high availability involves deploying resources across multiple AZs.
- **Instance Behavior**:
  - Instances remain on the same host unless the host fails or is taken down for maintenance.
  - When stopped and started (as opposed to restarted), an instance may relocate to a different host within the same AZ.

5. Storage and Networking Details
----------------------------------
- **Local Storage (Instance Store)**:
  - Temporary storage that exists on the EC2 host.
  - Data is lost if the instance moves to another host.
- **Remote Storage (EBS)**:
  - Elastic Block Store volumes are available only within the same AZ as the host.
  - EBS and network interfaces are AZ-specific; cross-AZ connections are not supported.
- **Networking**:
  - Each instance gets a primary elastic network interface linked to physical hardware.
  - Multiple network interfaces can be attached to an instance within the same AZ.
  - Networking is divided into storage networking and data networking.

6. EC2 Use Cases & Benefits
----------------------------
- **Traditional OS & Application Compute**:
  - Ideal for workloads requiring a full operating system (Linux, Windows) and persistent, long-running compute needs.
- **Monolithic Application Stacks**:
  - Suitable for applications with integrated components (databases, middleware, etc.) running on a traditional VM.
- **Migration & Disaster Recovery**:
  - Effective for migrating traditional workloads or setting up disaster recovery environments.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - EC2 supports both burstable and steady state workloads.
  - The AZ isolation offers a design advantage by limiting the failure domain.

7. Conclusion
-------------
- The architecture of EC2 is fundamentally tied to the concept of availability zones.
- Understanding the physical placement of EC2 hosts, the storage and networking constraints, and the differences between shared and dedicated hosts is critical for both exam preparation and effective architectural design.
- The lesson reinforces that the strength of EC2 lies in its AZ resilience, making it a robust choice for a wide range of traditional computing workloads.
