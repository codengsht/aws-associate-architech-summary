5-Storage Refresher
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- This lesson offers a refresher on key storage concepts, preparing you for deeper AWS storage topics.
- It emphasizes understanding the appropriate type of storage to choose based on specific application requirements and exam scenarios.

2. Key Storage Terms
--------------------
- **Direct Attach / Local Attached Storage:**  
  - Physical disks directly connected to a device (e.g., the instance store on EC2 hosts).
  - Offers high capacity but is vulnerableâ€”if the disk or hardware fails, data is lost.
  
- **Network Attached Storage:**  
  - Volumes created and attached over a network.
  - In AWS, this is provided by the Elastic Block Store (EBS), which is separate from instance hardware and highly resilient.

- **Ephemeral Storage vs. Persistent Storage:**  
  - *Ephemeral Storage:* Temporary storage (e.g., EC2 instance store) that does not persist beyond the life of the instance.
  - *Persistent Storage:* Remains available independently of the instance's life (e.g., EBS volumes).

3. Types of Storage
-------------------
- **Block Storage:**  
  - Consists of a collection of addressable blocks with no inherent file structure.
  - The operating system creates and mounts a file system (e.g., NTFS, EXT3).
  - Commonly used for boot volumes (most EC2 instances boot from an EBS volume) and high-performance storage needs.
  
- **File Storage:**  
  - Provided by a file server as a ready-made file system.
  - Access is via a folder structure; it cannot be used for booting an OS.
  - Ideal for shared file systems where multiple clients access the same data.
  
- **Object Storage:**  
  - A flat storage system where data is stored as objects with metadata.
  - Accessed using keys; lacks a hierarchical file system.
  - Highly scalable (e.g., Amazon S3) but not mountable or bootable.

Comparison of Storage Types
-------------------------
| Storage Type    | Characteristics                                                       | Bootable? | Use Cases                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Block Storage   | Raw, addressable blocks; OS creates file system; can be HDDs/SSDs       | Yes       | Boot volumes, high-performance application storage   |
| File Storage    | Pre-built file system; accessed via folder structure                   | No        | Shared file systems, file servers                    |
| Object Storage  | Flat storage of objects with metadata; key-based retrieval             | No        | Scalable storage for data like images, backups, logs |

4. Storage Performance Metrics
------------------------------
- **I/O Block Size:**  
  - The unit size (in kilobytes or megabytes) of data being read/written.
  - Larger block sizes can improve throughput if supported by the storage system.

- **IOPs (Input/Output Operations per Second):**  
  - Measures the number of read/write operations a storage system can perform in a second.
  - Comparable to the engine speed in a race car analogy.

- **Throughput:**  
  - The rate of data transfer, typically expressed in MB/s.
  - Calculated as I/O block size multiplied by IOPs, though it may be capped by other system limitations.
  
- **Interdependency:**  
  - Maximum performance is dictated by the lowest-performing element in the chain (application, OS, storage subsystem, network, physical media).
  - Choosing the right block size and maximizing IOPs are crucial for optimizing throughput.

5. Conclusion
-------------
- The lesson reinforces the differences between ephemeral (temporary) and persistent storage in AWS.
- Understanding block, file, and object storage types is essential for choosing the right storage solution.
- Familiarity with performance metrics like IOPs, block size, and throughput will help you meet application requirements and succeed in exam questions.
- This foundational knowledge sets the stage for further exploration of AWS-specific storage options in upcoming lessons.
