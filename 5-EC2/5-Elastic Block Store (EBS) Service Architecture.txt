5-Elastic Block Store (EBS) Service Architecture
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- Amazon EBS is a block storage service integral to AWS.
- It provides persistent, raw block storage volumes that can be addressed by block IDs.
- EBS is used both directly and indirectly by various AWS services and applications.

2. How EBS Works
---------------
- **Block Storage:**  
  - EBS aggregates physical disks and presents them as volumes.
  - Volumes appear as standard storage devices to EC2 instances, allowing file systems (e.g., EXT3, EXT4, XFS for Linux; NTFS for Windows) to be created on them.
- **Encryption Option:**  
  - Volumes can be created as unencrypted or encrypted (using AWS KMS; encryption details are covered in a separate lesson).

3. Volume Attachment & Persistence
------------------------------------
- **Attachment:**  
  - When attached to an EC2 instance, EBS volumes function as block devices.
  - They are connected over a storage network.
- **Persistence:**  
  - Volumes are independent of the EC2 instance lifecycle. They persist across instance stops, restarts, or host migrations.
  - Volumes can be detached from one instance and reattached to another (within the same Availability Zone).
- **Multi-Attach:**  
  - Some volume types support multi-attach, allowing a single volume to be connected to multiple instances. However, this requires careful application-level management to avoid data corruption.

4. Availability Zone Considerations
-------------------------------------
- **AZ-Based Provisioning:**  
  - EBS volumes are provisioned in a specific Availability Zone (AZ).
  - An EC2 instance can only attach volumes from the same AZ.
- **Resiliency Within an AZ:**  
  - EBS replicates data across multiple physical devices in the same AZ, providing built-in resiliency.
  - In the event of a complete AZ failure, both the instances and the EBS volumes within that AZ would be affected.

5. Snapshots and Regional Resilience
--------------------------------------
- **Snapshots:**  
  - Snapshots are backups of EBS volumes stored in Amazon S3.
  - They capture only the used data (not the entire allocated size) and are incremental.
- **Benefits of Snapshots:**  
  - Snapshots are regionally resilient; data is replicated across AZs within a region.
  - They enable volume recovery and migration across different AZs or even different regions.

6. Billing and Pricing
----------------------
- **Pricing Model:**  
  - EBS charges are based on the storage capacity used (measured in gigabytes per month).
  - Billing is proportional: 1 GB for one month costs the same as 2 GB for half a month.
- **Additional Costs:**  
  - Some volume types with enhanced performance characteristics may incur extra charges.

7. Overall Architecture
-----------------------
- **Regional & AZ Structure:**  
  - EBS is an Availability Zoneâ€“based service; each region has multiple AZs, each with its own EBS deployment.
  - For example, a region like US East 1 may have AZ A and AZ B, each with separate EBS infrastructures.
- **Integration with S3:**  
  - Snapshots are stored in S3, allowing data to be migrated or recovered across AZs and regions.

8. Conclusion
-------------
- Amazon EBS provides reliable, block-level storage that is essential for EC2 instances.
- Key points include its persistent nature, AZ-specific provisioning, and the ability to back up data via snapshots.
- Understanding these fundamentals is critical for designing resilient architectures and for success in AWS exams.
