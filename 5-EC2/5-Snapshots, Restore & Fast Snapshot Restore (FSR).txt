5-Snapshots, Restore & Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
==============================================

1. Introduction
---------------
- **Purpose:** EBS snapshots provide a reliable and efficient method to back up EBS volumes by storing their data on S3.
- **Benefits:**
  - Protects data against availability zone issues or local hardware failures.
  - Enables migration of EBS volume data between availability zones or even AWS regions.
  - Increases data resilience by leveraging S3’s regional durability.

2. How Snapshots Work
----------------------
- **Backup Mechanism:**
  - **Initial Snapshot:**  
    - Creates a full backup of the volume’s used data (not the total allocated size).
    - May take longer to complete depending on the amount of data.
  - **Incremental Snapshots:**  
    - Only capture changes made since the previous snapshot.
    - Each incremental snapshot is self-sufficient; they reference previous snapshots for unchanged data.
- **Data Storage:**  
  - Snapshots are stored on S3, making them regionally resilient.
  - They serve as a point-in-time backup that can be used to restore or clone volumes.

3. Usage and Flexibility
-------------------------
- **Volume Creation:**  
  - New EBS volumes can be created either as blank or from an existing snapshot.
  - When created from a snapshot, the restore happens lazily; data is pulled from S3 on first access.
- **Cross-AZ and Cross-Region Migration:**
  - Snapshots enable the creation of volumes in a different availability zone than the source.
  - They can also be copied to different regions, supporting global disaster recovery and migration strategies.

4. Performance Considerations
-----------------------------
- **Lazy Restoration:**  
  - When a volume is restored from a snapshot, data is transferred from S3 in the background.
  - Initial reads of blocks not yet restored may experience lower performance.
- **Forced Initialization:**  
  - Tools like `dd` (on Linux) can be used to read every block, triggering immediate data restoration.
- **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):**  
  - Option to configure snapshots for instant volume restoration.
  - Limited to 50 FSR sets per region and incurs additional cost.

5. Cost Considerations
----------------------
- **Billing:**  
  - Snapshots are charged based on the actual amount of used data (GB-month), not the total allocated volume size.
  - Incremental nature means that only changed data is stored in subsequent snapshots, optimizing storage costs.
- **Efficiency:**  
  - Frequent snapshots are feasible without significant cost increases since only differences are recorded.

6. Visual Overview
------------------
- **Snapshot Chain:**  
  - **First Snapshot:** Full copy of all used data from the source volume.
  - **Subsequent Snapshots:** Only new or changed data is saved, referencing earlier snapshots for unchanged data.
  
  -----------------------------
  | Snapshot         | Data Stored                     | Key Point                         |
  |------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Initial Snapshot | Full copy of used data          | Takes longer; complete backup     |
  | Subsequent Snapshots | Only changed/new data         | Faster and more cost-efficient    |
  -----------------------------

7. Conclusion
-------------
- **Primary Use:**  
  - Use snapshots to back up EBS volumes for resilience, recovery, and data migration.
- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Snapshots are incremental and stored in S3, ensuring regional durability.
  - Restoring volumes from snapshots may require initialization to achieve full performance.
  - Fast Snapshot Restore is available for instant performance but comes at an extra cost.
- **Exam Relevance:**  
  - Understand these mechanisms and tradeoffs to answer questions on backup, recovery, and migration strategies in AWS.
