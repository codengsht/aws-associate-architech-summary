4-VPC Subnets
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: Subnets are the building blocks within a VPC where AWS resources are launched.
- **Role in Network Design**: They provide structure, isolation, and high availability by being tied to individual Availability Zones (AZs).

2. What is a Subnet?
--------------------
- **Definition**: A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC, created in a specific AZ.
- **Key Property**: 
  - A subnet is confined to one AZ and cannot span multiple AZs.
  - An AZ can contain multiple subnets.

3. IP Address Allocation and Reserved Addresses
-------------------------------------------------
- **IPv4 Subnet CIDR**:
  - The subnet’s CIDR must be a subset of the VPC’s CIDR and cannot overlap with other subnets.
- **Reserved IP Addresses in Every Subnet** (Total 5):
  - **Network Address**: First IP of the subnet.
  - **Network +1**: Reserved for the VPC router.
  - **Network +2**: Reserved for DNS resolution.
  - **Network +3**: Reserved for future use.
  - **Broadcast Address**: Last IP address in the subnet (even though AWS doesn’t support broadcast, it is reserved).
- **Example**: In a subnet with 16 total IPs, only 11 IPs are usable.

4. Additional Subnet Features
-----------------------------
- **IPv6 Support**:
  - Subnets can also be assigned an IPv6 CIDR (a /64 block is a subset of the VPC’s /56 if enabled).
- **Public vs. Private Subnets**:
  - By default, subnets are private. Public subnets require configuration (e.g., auto-assign public IPv4 addresses, Internet Gateway).
- **DHCP Option Sets**:
  - A VPC has a DHCP option set that defines DNS servers and other network configuration settings, which automatically flow to subnets.

5. Subnets and Availability Zones
-----------------------------------
- **Availability Zone Assignment**:
  - Each subnet is created in one specific AZ.
  - For high availability, distribute resources across subnets in different AZs.
- **Design Example**:
  - A multi-tier VPC might include subnets for web, application, and database tiers in three AZs (resulting in 9 subnets) plus additional subnets reserved for future use.

6. Practical Considerations for the Exam and Real-World Design
--------------------------------------------------------------
- **Non-overlapping IP Ranges**: 
  - Ensure that each subnet’s IP range is unique within the VPC.
- **Subnet Sizing**:
  - Consider future growth; smaller subnets (e.g., /28 or /27) provide few usable IPs.
  - Plan based on the required number of resources and expected expansion.
- **Manual Creation vs. Automation**:
  - Manually creating subnets helps build an understanding of IP range assignments.
  - CloudFormation templates can later automate the process once you’re familiar with the structure.
