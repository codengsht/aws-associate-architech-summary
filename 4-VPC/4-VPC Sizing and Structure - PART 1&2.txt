4-VPC Sizing and Structure - PART 1 & 2
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: Learn to design an IP addressing plan and VPC structure that meets business needs and future growth, avoiding conflicts with external networks.
- **Context**: This is a high-level design process used by solutions architects for planning AWS networks, beyond mere technical configuration.

2. Key Planning Considerations
------------------------------
- **Pre-Planning is Critical**:
  - Decide on the overall IP range (CIDR) for your VPC before deployment.
  - A good plan avoids overlapping IP ranges with existing networks (e.g., on-premises, partner, or other cloud environments).
- **Avoid Common IP Ranges**:
  - Many default networks use common ranges like 10.0.x.x.
  - Choose a less common range (e.g., starting at 10.16.x.x) to avoid conflicts.
- **Future Growth**:
  - Plan for expansion by anticipating additional regions, accounts, and increased network requirements.
  - Build in buffer ranges to accommodate growth over time.

3. Structuring the VPC
-----------------------
- **Overall VPC Size**:
  - VPCs can range from /28 (16 addresses) to /16 (over 65,000 addresses).
  - For scalable production environments, a /16 VPC is often chosen.
- **Dividing the VPC**:
  - **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Typically design for three AZs as a minimum, plus an extra “spare” AZ for future resiliency.
  - **Tiers or Layers**: Common tiers include Web, Application, Database, plus a spare for future needs.
  - **Example**: With four tiers across four AZs, you need 16 subnets (one per tier in each AZ).

4. Subnet Sizing and Allocation
-------------------------------
- **Subnet Allocation**:
  - Subnets are carved out of the VPC CIDR block.
  - The size of each subnet is determined by the VPC’s CIDR and the number of required subnets.
- **Example Calculation**:
  - A /16 VPC divided into 16 subnets results in each subnet being a /20.
  - A /20 subnet provides approximately 491 usable IP addresses.
- **Methodology**:
  - Determine the number of subnets needed (based on AZs and application tiers).
  - Ensure each subnet's range does not overlap and has sufficient capacity for current and future resource needs.

5. Practical Example: Animals For Life Organization
-----------------------------------------------------
- **Business Scenario**:
  - Global organization with operations in multiple regions (e.g., US, Europe, Australia) and several AWS accounts.
  - Must avoid IP ranges used by existing networks (e.g., known ranges from partners or vendors like Google Cloud).
- **IP Planning**:
  - Reserve a range starting at 10.16.x.x, avoiding common defaults.
  - Pre-allocate enough distinct CIDR blocks for each region and AWS account.
  - For example, if planning for 5 regions and 4 AWS accounts, plan for up to 40 distinct IP ranges to support multiple VPCs per region/account.
- **Documentation**:
  - Create a detailed IP plan (e.g., a PDF or spreadsheet) to document reserved ranges, allocations per region/account, and subnet breakdowns.
  - This plan will be your reference during deployment and for future expansion.

6. Summary and Best Practices
------------------------------
- **Holistic Network Design**: Combine business requirements, current network usage, and future growth projections.
- **Avoid Overlaps**: Ensure the chosen CIDR blocks do not conflict with other networks your business interacts with.
- **Plan Subnet Structure**: Design subnets based on availability zones and application tiers (e.g., 16 subnets in a /16 VPC for 4 AZs and 4 tiers).
- **Document and Review**: Maintain a clear IP addressing document for troubleshooting and scalability planning.
