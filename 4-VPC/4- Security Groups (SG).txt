4- Security Groups (SG)
========================================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose**: Security groups act as virtual firewalls for AWS resources (attached to network interfaces) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Nature**: They are stateful—once an inbound rule allows a connection, the corresponding response traffic is automatically allowed.

2. Key Characteristics
-----------------------
- **Stateful Operation**:
  - No need to explicitly allow response traffic.
  - Rules are applied based on connection state; if a request is permitted, its response is implicitly allowed.
- **Implicit Deny**:
  - Security groups only allow traffic that is explicitly permitted.
  - There is no option for an explicit deny rule; all traffic not allowed is automatically denied.
- **Attachment**:
  - Security groups are not directly attached to instances but to their primary network interfaces (ENIs).

3. Rule Configuration
-----------------------
- **Inbound Rules**: Specify allowed incoming traffic (e.g., TCP port 443 from any source for a web server).
- **Outbound Rules**: Specify allowed outgoing traffic.
- **Logical References**:
  - Security groups can reference other security groups.
  - This allows rules to dynamically apply to any resource associated with the referenced security group (e.g., allowing traffic from all instances in a “web” security group to instances in an “app” security group).
  - Self-referencing is also supported to allow intra-group communication, which is especially useful in auto scaling groups or clustered applications.

4. Comparison with Network ACLs (NACLs)
----------------------------------------
- **Security Groups**:
  - **Stateful**: Automatically track connection state.
  - **Rules**: Only support explicit allow rules (all other traffic is implicitly denied).
  - **Granularity**: Can reference AWS logical resources (other security groups) for flexible access control.
- **NACLs**:
  - **Stateless**: Require separate rules for request and response.
  - **Rules**: Support both explicit allow and explicit deny.
  - **Usage**: Often used in conjunction with security groups to block specific IP addresses or ranges.

5. Practical Considerations
---------------------------
- **Scaling & Management**:
  - Logical referencing simplifies management as new instances inherit the security group’s rules automatically.
  - Useful for multi-tier applications where different layers (web, app, database) require distinct but interrelated access controls.
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot block specific traffic via explicit deny; for that, NACLs must be used.
