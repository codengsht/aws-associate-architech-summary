4-VPC Routing, Internet Gateway & Bastion Hosts
========================================

1. VPC Router & Route Tables
-----------------------------
- **VPC Router**: A highly available router present in every VPC that automatically handles traffic between subnets.
  - Each subnet gets a router interface (using reserved IPs, e.g., network+1 for the VPC router).
- **Route Tables**:
  - Define how traffic leaves a subnet.
  - Every VPC has a main route table; custom route tables can be associated with specific subnets.
  - Local routes (covering the entire VPC CIDR for IPv4/IPv6) are automatically present and cannot be modified.
  - Routes are selected based on the most specific (highest prefix) match.

2. Internet Gateway (IGW)
--------------------------
- **Function**: Enables communication between the VPC and the public Internet.
  - Must be attached to the VPC; a VPC can have at most one IGW.
  - It is regionally resilient and functions across all Availability Zones in the VPC.
- **Traffic Flow with Public IPs**:
  - Instances launch with private IPv4 addresses only.
  - When a public IPv4 address is allocated, the IGW maintains a mapping between the instance’s private IP and its public IP.
  - Outbound packets leaving an instance have their source IP translated by the IGW to the public IP, and vice versa for inbound responses.
- **IPv6 Behavior**:
  - With IPv6, the instance’s address is public and configured on the OS; no NAT is performed.

3. Bastion Hosts (Jump Boxes)
------------------------------
- **Purpose**: Serve as secure entry points for managing resources in private subnets.
  - Typically deployed in a public subnet.
  - Users connect to the bastion host (via SSH/RDP) and then access private instances.
- **Security Consideration**:
  - Often restricted by source IP or other authentication measures.
  - Though widely used, bastion hosts are now supplemented by more secure access methods in modern architectures.

4. Key Points for the Exam and Real-World Design
--------------------------------------------------
- **Routing Fundamentals**:
  - Route tables control how traffic is forwarded based on destination IP ranges.
  - The most specific route (higher prefix value) is chosen.
- **IGW Characteristics**:
  - One-to-one relationship with a VPC.
  - Facilitates NAT for IPv4 while IPv6 addresses remain unchanged.
- **Subnet Association**:
  - A subnet’s route table determines whether it is “public” (if it has a default route pointing to an IGW) or “private.”
- **Bastion Host Role**:
  - Acts as a single point of entry into private networks; an essential component for secure management in many AWS architectures.
