16-AWS Config 
==============

1. Introduction
---------------
- AWS Config is a service that continuously monitors and records the configurations of AWS resources.
- It is essential for audit and compliance purposes, especially in exam scenarios where making rapid architectural decisions is required.
- AWS Config does not prevent configuration changes; instead, it tracks “what” changed, “when” it changed, and “who” made the change.

2. Core Functions of AWS Config
-------------------------------
- **Configuration Recording:**
  - Once enabled, AWS Config records every configuration change as a configuration item.
  - A configuration item captures:
    - The resource’s configuration details at a specific point in time.
    - Its relationships to other resources.
    - Information about who initiated the change.
  - Example: If a rule is added to a security group attached to an EC2 instance, both pre- and post-change states are logged.

- **Compliance Auditing:**
  - AWS Config compares resource configurations against defined internal standards or regulatory requirements.
  - It marks resources as either compliant or noncompliant without blocking changes.
  - This helps organizations detect deviation from policies, such as security groups exposing disallowed ports.

3. AWS Config Architecture & Data Flow
----------------------------------------
- **Regional Service:**
  - AWS Config operates on a per-region basis, monitoring resources within each region.
  - It supports cross-region and cross-account aggregation, allowing centralized visibility.
- **Data Storage:**
  - All configuration history and snapshots are stored in a designated S3 Config bucket.
  - Data can be accessed via the AWS Config console, APIs, or directly from the S3 bucket.
- **Event Notifications & Integration:**
  - AWS Config can send notifications using SNS.
  - It can generate events through EventBridge (or CloudWatch Events) to trigger automated remediation.
  - Integration with Systems Manager allows automated fixes for noncompliant resources.

4. Optional Components: Config Rules
--------------------------------------
- **Config Rules:**
  - These are policies that evaluate whether resource configurations comply with desired settings.
  - They come in two forms:
    - **AWS Managed Rules:** Predefined and maintained by AWS.
    - **Custom Rules:** Defined by the user, often using Lambda functions to implement specific logic.
  - Based on rule evaluations, resources are tagged as “compliant” or “noncompliant.”
  - Config Rules can trigger notifications or automated remediation actions (via EventBridge or Systems Manager).

5. Comparison Table: AWS Config Standard vs. Config Rules (Optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| Component                  | Standard AWS Config                                  | Config Rules (Optional)                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Function           | Records configuration changes over time            | Evaluates resource compliance against defined policies           |
| Data Captured              | Resource configurations, relationships, change maker | Compliance status (compliant/noncompliant) based on custom criteria |
| Change Prevention          | Does not prevent changes                             | Does not prevent changes, but can trigger remediation actions      |
| Storage                    | Configuration items stored in an S3 Config bucket    | Results stored as part of the configuration evaluation             |
| Notification & Automation  | Generates events (SNS, EventBridge)                  | Can trigger notifications and automate remediation via Lambda/SSM   |

6. Exam & Real-World Considerations
------------------------------------
- **Key Exam Points:**
  - AWS Config is used primarily for auditing and historical tracking of resource configurations.
  - It does not enforce policies or stop changes; it only reports them.
  - If exam questions refer to compliance evaluation, automated remediation, or a history of configuration changes, AWS Config (and optionally, Config Rules) is the appropriate service.
- **Real-World Use Cases:**
  - Auditing resource changes over time.
  - Enabling compliance checks to ensure organizational policies are followed.
  - Triggering automated responses to configuration drifts via integration with SNS, EventBridge, Lambda, or Systems Manager.

7. Conclusion
-------------
- AWS Config provides detailed visibility into the configuration state of your resources, capturing changes, relationships, and user actions.
- It serves as a foundational tool for compliance auditing and can be extended with Config Rules for active evaluation and remediation.
- Understanding its capabilities is crucial for making informed architectural decisions and excelling in exam scenarios.
