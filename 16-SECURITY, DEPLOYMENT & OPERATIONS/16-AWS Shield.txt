16-AWS Shield
========================
1. Introduction
---------------
- AWS Shield is a managed service that protects internet-connected environments from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- There are two tiers:
  - **Shield Standard:** Automatically provided at no extra cost.
  - **Shield Advanced:** A premium service with enhanced features and proactive support.
- Understanding the differences between these offerings is crucial for both exam scenarios and real-world applications.

2. DDoS Attack Types
--------------------
- **Volumetric Attacks (Layer 3):**
  - Aim to overwhelm a target with massive amounts of network traffic.
- **Network Protocol Attacks (Layer 4):**
  - Exploit protocol weaknesses (e.g., SYN floods) by initiating a large number of connections.
- **Application Layer Attacks (Layer 7):**
  - Target specific application behaviors (e.g., HTTP floods) to exhaust processing resources.

3. AWS Shield Standard
----------------------
- **Cost:** Free for all AWS customers.
- **Protection Scope:**
  - Provides baseline defense against common network and transport layer (L3 & L4) attacks.
  - Works automatically at the network perimeter for resources such as CloudFront, Route 53, and Global Accelerator.
- **Limitations:**
  - Lacks advanced proactive features, detailed real-time metrics, and integration with additional DDoS mitigation tools.

4. AWS Shield Advanced
----------------------
- **Cost:** Approximately $3,000 per month per organization (with a one-year commitment) plus data transfer fees.
- **Enhanced Capabilities:**
  - **Expanded Protection:** Covers volumetric, protocol, and application layer (L7) attacks.
  - **Proactive Engagement:** Offers access to the AWS Shield Response Team for rapid incident response and support.
  - **Integration with WAF:** Leverages AWS WAF to mitigate application-layer attacks using customized rules.
  - **Advanced Metrics & Reporting:** Provides real-time detailed insights via the Shield Advanced console, APIs, and CloudWatch.
  - **Cost Protection:** Shields against costs arising from scaling events triggered by DDoS attacks.
  - **Health-Based Detection:** Uses Route 53 health checks to reduce false positives and improve attack detection.
  - **Protection Groups:** Allows grouping of resources to simplify management and provide unified protection.
