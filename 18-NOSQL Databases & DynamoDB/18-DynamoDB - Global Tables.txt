18-DynamoDB - Global Tables
=============================

1. Overview
-----------
- **Purpose:** Introduce DynamoDB Global Tables as a solution for global database deployments.
- **Focus:** 
  - Multi-master replication across regions.
  - Architectural design for high availability and low latency.
  - Key exam considerations including conflict resolution and consistency.

2. Global Table Architecture
----------------------------
- **Multi-Master Replication:** 
  - All regional tables are peers—no single master.
  - Enables both read and write operations in any AWS region.
- **Implementation Process:**
  - **Step 1:** Create DynamoDB tables in each desired AWS region.
  - **Step 2:** On one of the tables (choice does not matter), configure links to the others.
  - **Outcome:** All tables become replicas as part of a global table with replication occurring typically within a second.

3. Conflict Resolution
-----------------------
- **Approach:** Last Writer Wins.
- **Explanation:**
  - When the same record is updated concurrently in different regions, the most recent write is replicated to all tables.
  - Ensures a simple, predictable outcome for conflicts.

4. Consistency Considerations
-----------------------------
- **Intra-Region Reads:** 
  - Can be strongly consistent, meaning the read returns the latest data.
- **Inter-Region Reads:** 
  - Only eventually consistent due to replication lag.
- **Key Point:** Applications using global tables must tolerate eventual consistency when accessing data across regions.

5. Use Cases and Benefits
--------------------------
- **Global Availability:** 
  - Provides high availability by enabling local read and write operations.
- **Performance:** 
  - Reduces latency for users distributed worldwide.
- **Disaster Recovery:** 
  - Offers robust business continuity by replicating data across multiple regions.
- **Cost-Effective:** 
  - Simplifies global deployments without the need for complex, self-managed replication processes.

6. Summary Table: Global Tables Key Aspects
--------------------------------------------
| Aspect             | Description                                                                          | Notes/Use Cases                                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-Master       | All tables are equal; no designated master.                                          | Supports local reads/writes in any region.                  |
| Replication        | Data is replicated across regions, typically within one second.                      | Ensures near real-time data synchronization globally.       |
| Conflict Resolution| Uses "last writer wins" to resolve concurrent updates.                               | Offers predictable conflict resolution.                     |
| Consistency        | Strongly consistent within the same region; eventually consistent for cross-region.  | Applications must handle potential read lag across regions.  |
| Deployment         | Create tables in selected regions and link them as part of a single global table.       | Ideal for high availability, low latency, and disaster recovery. |

7. Exam Power-Up Points
-----------------------
- **Architectural Insight:** Global tables are based on multi-master replication with a simple, predictable setup.
- **Conflict Management:** Understand that conflicts are resolved using the last writer wins approach.
- **Consistency Models:** 
  - Local operations can be strongly consistent.
  - Global operations are eventually consistent—applications must be designed accordingly.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Know that global tables are set up by linking individual regional tables.

8. Conclusion
-------------
- **Key Takeaway:** 
  - DynamoDB Global Tables enable a globally distributed, highly available database solution with multi-master replication.
- **Benefits:**
  - Lower latency and improved performance for global applications.
  - Simplified architecture for disaster recovery and business continuity.
- **Exam Tip:** 
  - Focus on the architectural principles: multi-master replication, eventual consistency, and conflict resolution via "last writer wins."
