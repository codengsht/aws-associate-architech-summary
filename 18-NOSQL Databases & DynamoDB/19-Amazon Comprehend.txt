- **Analysis Capabilities:**
  - **Entities:** Recognizes names, organizations, locations, and more.
  - **Key Phrases:** Extracts important words or phrases from text.
  - **Language Detection:** Identifies the language used in the document.
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies text sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, mixed) with associated confidence scores.
  - **PII Detection:** Identifies sensitive data like credit card numbers, emails, and other personal details.
- **Processing Options:**
  - **Real-Time Analysis:** Suitable for small, interactive workloads.
  - **Batch Processing:** Supports asynchronous jobs for analyzing larger datasets.
- **Access Methods:**
  - Can be used via the AWS Console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and APIs for integration into applications.

3. Demonstration Walkthrough
----------------------------
- **Console Demo:**
  - The instructor logs into the AWS Console and navigates to the Amazon Comprehend service.
  - Uses sample text to demonstrate how the service extracts insights:
    - **Entities:** Identifies persons (e.g., "John") and organizations (e.g., company names) along with confidence scores (e.g., 99%).
    - **Key Phrases:** Highlights significant phrases in the text.
    - **Language:** Detects the text as English.
    - **PII:** Flags sensitive details such as credit card information.
    - **Sentiment:** Analyzes text sentiment; for example, shows neutral sentiment for certain inputs and mixed sentiment when contrasting opinions are mentioned.
