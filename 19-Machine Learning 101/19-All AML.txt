  - Provides forecast explainability to identify underlying factors (such as weather influences).
- **Exam Power Up Points:**
  - Know the importance of importing historical data and additional contextual data to generate reliable forecasts.

====================================================================
10. Amazon Fraud Detector
--------------------------

  - Processes historical transactional data to build a risk profile.
  - Supports the creation of decision logic rules based on event scores.
- **Exam Power Up Points:**
  - Distinguish between the different fraud model types based on data availability (new accounts vs. transactional history).

====================================================================
11. Amazon SageMaker
---------------------
- **Main Function:** Full Machine Learning Lifecycle Management
- **Key Details:**
  - Provides integrated tools (SageMaker Studio, domains, containers) for managing the complete ML lifecycle from data preparation to deployment.
  - Uses containerized environments on ML-specific EC2 instances.
  - Note: SageMaker itself incurs no direct service cost, but the underlying compute resources do.
- **Exam Power Up Points:**
  - Recognize the use of containerization (with ML-prefixed instance types) and the overall workflow for developing and deploying models.
