11-ASG HealthCheck Comparison - EC2 vs ELB
==============================================

1. Purpose of Health Checks
---------------------------
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) use health checks to monitor the state of EC2 instances.
- If an instance fails a health check, the ASG automatically terminates it and provisions a replacement, enabling self-healing.

2. Types of Health Checks
-------------------------
a. **EC2 Health Checks (Default):**
   - Evaluate the instance based on EC2 status (e.g., running, impaired, stopping, terminated).
   - Any state other than "running" is considered unhealthy.

b. **ELB Health Checks:**
   - Can be integrated into ASGs when using an Elastic Load Balancer.
   - Require instances to be both running and passing the ELB's application-aware health check.
   - Useful when you need to ensure the application (not just the instance) is functioning properly (e.g., checking a specific URL or header).

c. **Custom Health Checks:**
   - Allow integration with external systems.
   - You can mark instances as healthy or unhealthy based on business-specific criteria.

3. Health Check Grace Period
----------------------------
- A configurable period (default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes) during which an instance is exempt from health checks after launch.
- This grace period ensures that instances have sufficient time to boot, run startup scripts, and complete configuration.
- Insufficient grace period may lead to premature marking of instances as unhealthy, causing continuous termination and provisioning.

4. Key Takeaways for the Exam
-----------------------------
- ASGs replace instances automatically if health checks (EC2, ELB, or custom) indicate failure.
- Understand the differences between EC2, ELB, and custom health checks.
- The health check grace period is critical for avoiding unnecessary instance cycling during application initialization.
