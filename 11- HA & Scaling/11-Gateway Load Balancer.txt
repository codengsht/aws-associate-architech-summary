11-Gateway Load Balancer
==============================================

1. Purpose & Use Cases
-----------------------
• Designed to integrate and scale third-party security appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS, data analysis tools) in AWS.
• Ideal for scenarios requiring transparent, inline inspection and filtering of both inbound and outbound traffic.
• Enables organizations to use existing security solutions within AWS while maintaining elasticity and resilience.

2. Key Components
-----------------
• **Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints:**
  - Function similarly to VPC interface endpoints.
  - Configured in VPC route tables to direct relevant traffic to the GWLB.
• **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
  - Distributes incoming packets across a fleet of backend security appliance instances.
  - Uses the Gene protocol to encapsulate packets into tunnels, preserving original source/destination IP addresses and ports.

3. How It Works
---------------
• Traffic Flow:
  - Client traffic enters the VPC (via an Internet Gateway) and is routed by the VPC route table to a GWLB endpoint.
  - The GWLB receives the packets and encapsulates them using the Gene tunneling protocol.
  - Encapsulated packets are forwarded to one of the backend security appliances (running on EC2 instances).
  - The security appliance inspects, filters, or analyzes the packets and then returns them through the same tunnel.
  - The GWLB de-encapsulates the packets and routes them back through the GWLB endpoint to their intended destination.
• Transparency:
  - Original packet attributes (IP addresses, ports, etc.) remain unaltered, ensuring that security appliances can accurately perform their functions.

4. Benefits
-----------
• **Scalability & Resilience:**
  - Horizontally scales by load balancing across multiple security appliance instances.
  - Provides flow stickiness, ensuring consistent handling of individual traffic flows.
• **Operational Transparency:**
  - Maintains the integrity of the original packet information, critical for in-depth security analysis.
• **Flexible Integration:**
  - Supports seamless deployment of third-party security solutions, which can be scaled dynamically as application demand changes.
• **Simplified Architecture:**
  - Decouples security processing from application logic, allowing both layers to scale and fail independently.

5. Architectural Recap
----------------------
• GWLB endpoints are added to your VPC route tables, directing traffic to the GWLB.
• The GWLB encapsulates traffic via the Gene protocol and forwards it to backend security appliances.
• After processing, traffic is de-encapsulated and returned to its destination, ensuring end-to-end transparency.
• This model supports elastic and resilient security architectures, particularly for multi-tenant or large-scale environments.
